{% mark excerpt -%}

Since July 2014 I am adjoint professor of fluid dynamics at the
Mechanical Department of the State University of Rio de Janeiro (UERJ)
located at Maracana neighbourhood in the city of Rio de Janeiro. I
dedicate my work time in teaching and research.

Currently I'm teaching Fundamentals of Heat and Transfer I and II for
undergraduate students and Multiphase Flows for graduate students
(master and doctoral levels). Moreover I am the coordinator of the
Seminars Sections of the Graduate Program in Mechanical Engineering of
PPG-EM/UERJ. 

I am part of the International Conference on Multiphase Flows (ICMF)
organizing committee of the next conference to be held in Rio de Janeiro
in May 2019.
