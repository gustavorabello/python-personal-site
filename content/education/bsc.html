I received my bachelor diploma (B.Eng.) in mechanical engineering at the
State University of Rio de Janeiro (UERJ) in 2005. In early 2003, I
started to be involved in research by participating in monitoring and
undergraduate research. During this period I focoused my studies on
fluid dynamics and finally presented my bachelor project

entitled "Atmospheric Boundary Layer Simulation in Wild Tunnel" where we
had analyzed experimentally the effects of fluid flow and its boundary
layer over a tropical and dense forest. This project had been started
after some issues of local measurement and thus the experimental
simulation in wind tunnel was performed to understand the atmospheric
conditions in the Amazon Rainforest. After this project I received the
mechanical engineer diploma.
