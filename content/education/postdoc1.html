{% mark excerpt -%}

The topic of the post-doc is boiling and condensation in convective flow
with multiple bubbles. The work is being performed in the Nuclear
Science and Engineering (NSE) at the Massachussetts Institute of
Technology (MIT).

# Motivation and approach

- Accurate prediction of the bubble size, which depends on the bubble
  departure diameter (initial condition) and the condensation rate;
- Identification of the PWR flow conditions including bubble sizes,
  shapes, non-dimensional numbers, etc;
- Literature review of data and empirical correlations for bubble
  condensation;
- Benchmark test cases to spot one physical effect at a time are divided
  as: Heat Transfer from a solid sphere, 1-dimensional Stefan Problem,
  Isothermal Bubble rise, Bubble growth in a liquid at rest (boiling),
  Bubble collapse in a liquid at rest (condensation).

# Results

The Table shows benchmark results for 2 different mesh refinement levels
compared to experimental results for a isothermal rising bubble. In
Figure with red background, the numerical simulation of a bubble growth
in a liquid at rest is compared to the well known Scriven solution for
the bubble history. The Table presents a summary of conditions and
applicability for pressurized water reactor (PWR) and 4 different models
found in the literature. It shows that none of the currently available
correlations is suitable for PWR application. These 4 correlations are
plotted in Figures for the PWR conditions. As can be seen, the
discrepancy of predicting bubble history and Nuc is large among them.

# Conclusions and further work

- Correlations were testes using different conditions and further
  evaluated at the pressurized water reactor conditions in terms of the
  bubble history β and the condensation Nusselt number Nuc during the
  condensation process of a detached vapor bubble.
- Current standard tool for prediction of liquid-to-bubble heat transfer
  is the Ranz and Marshall’s correlation (Ranz and Marshall, Jr., 1952).
  It was found that the available resources are insufficient to describe
  accurately the condensation process occurring at PWR conditions.
  However, we suggest the Chen and Meyinger’s correlation due to the
  easiness of implementation in numerical codes and its linear evolution
  with time (Fo);
- We have started direct numerical simulations of the bubble
  condensation process in subcooled flow boiling using the commercial
  code TransAT.
