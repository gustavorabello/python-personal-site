The figure shows bubble shape transition of the rising air bubble
immersed in sugar water solution. The numerical results were compared to
the widely cited experiments performed by Bhaga and Weber (1981). From
left to right, the viscosity of the liquid solution (dark brown color)
increases and thus the bubble shape changes.

The left hand side figure presents a smooth shape bubble (light brown
color) while the right hand side figure presents edges at the bubble
corners. It is possible to conclude that the viscosity of the liquid has
strong effect on the bubble shape.
