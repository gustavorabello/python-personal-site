{% mark excerpt -%}

The surface mesh is represented by interconnected triangular faces in
which a fully 3D vortex field distorts it. The surface mesh is initially
configured as a sphere and later assumes such a form. The field is then
reversed to recover the initial sphere shape.

The snapshot presented
here was taken in its strongest deformation. The surface mesh colored by
the magnitude of the vortex field velocity. The red color represents
high velocity, while the blue one stands for low intensity.
