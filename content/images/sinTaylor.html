{% mark excerpt -%}

This is a comparison between 1st order and 2nd order time integration
for a Taylor air bubble flowing thru a sinusoidal channel. It can be
seen the difference of bubble shape for the same simulation time between
both temporal approaches.

We conclude that the time discretization may change the bubble shape,
therefore changing the numerical result.
