This figure shows the numerical validation of a benchmark problem originally
proposed by Turek and colleagues for flow around a circular cylinder with an
attached downstream bar. The color map represents the velocity magnitude, with
blue indicating low values and red to yellow showing higher velocities. The
flow accelerates around the sides of the obstacle and develops a wake
characterized by recirculation and shear layers, consistent with the reference
benchmark.

The unstructured quadrilateral finite element mesh is also visible, capturing
both the cylinder and the narrow bar with good resolution in the boundary layer
and wake regions. The velocity scale on the right confirms a normalized maximum
around 2.0, matching the expected Turek validation range. Numerical results
such as drag, lift, and pressure drop can be compared directly with the Turek
paper to ensure accuracy of the solver. The mesh adapts well to the geometry,
showing refinement near solid boundaries and coarser elements far from the
obstacle. This setup is widely used to test stability and accuracy of ALEâ€“FEM
formulations in computational fluid dynamics. The qualitative agreement of the
flow pattern and velocity distribution demonstrates correct implementation of
the solver.
