Two-phase flow on a single vortex background flow. This benchmark is an
important tool to test the limits of the interface reconstruction.The
tetrahedral background mesh is colored by the magnitude of the vortex
field velocity.

The red color represents high velocity, while the blue one stands for
low intensity.
