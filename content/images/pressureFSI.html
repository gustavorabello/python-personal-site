{% mark excerpt -%}

This image depicts the pressure field around a circular obstacle in a
single-phase flow simulation involving fluid-structure interaction
(FSI). The central gray circle represents a solid structure immersed in
the fluid, where a high-pressure region forms upstream (red/yellow) due
to flow stagnation, and a low-pressure wake develops downstream (blue),
indicating flow separation.

The resulting pressure gradient around the
body contributes to drag forces and potentially induces structural
deformation. The asymmetric distribution in the wake suggests unsteady
behavior, such as vortex shedding. This visualization highlights the
strong coupling between fluid dynamics and structural response in
external FSI scenarios.
