{% mark excerpt -%}

Comparison of 5 different channel width in two-phase flow thought a
sinusoidal channel. The figure shows how the channel walls may affect
bubble rising velocity. It can also be seen that the sinusoidal channel
affects significantly bubble shape.

The simulation is therefore performed and results on the bubble flow
dynamics is achived.
