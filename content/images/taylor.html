{% mark excerpt -%}

Two-phase flow thought a microchannel. The figure shows the taylor
bubble flowing along the microchannel. It can be seen that the tail of
the bubble has a particular shape due to its motion.

Morevover, the surface mesh is non-uniform, i.e. in the tail is more
refined due to the strong deformation of this type of flow condition,
and the nose of the bubble is smooth and higher tringles can be used
instead, saving computational time.
