Snapshot of 2-dimensional two-phase flow of an ascendent bubble. The
figure shows one stage of the interface mesh motion with the normal
component of the velocity (red) and tangent component of the velocity
(blue) for all interface nodes.

Note that the normal high speed (represented here by the long arrows)
are found to be in the center of the image (bottom and top of the
interface), while the tangent high speed is found at the side-bottom of
the interface. The simulation is therefore carried out and results on
the bubble flow dynamics is achived.
