{% mark excerpt -%}

Break-up of bubble in two-phase flow thought a sinusoidal channel. The
figure shows the pressure field of a taylor bubble about to break the
interface up. The colors represent the scale of pressure along the
bubble length, where the red color stands for higher pressure, while the
blue one represents low pressure.

The non-dimensional pressure scale can be seen in the figure bar. After
the break-up, the bubble eventually would split in two bubbles and the
their dynamics would be different of the single bubble, since the volume
of each bubble are different if compared to the original one.
