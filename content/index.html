<p> I've been organizing this web page to make easy to you know a little
bit of my life and what I'm currently working on. My research field is
numerical simulation of two-phase flow. During my doctoral studies, I'd
been working in the discretization of the Navier-Stokes's equations with
a special modelling to describe intefacial forces in two-phase flows
through the Finite Element Method. The in-house numerical code is
designed by modern and flexible object-oriented languages: (<a
 href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C++</a>) and (<a
 href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>) which allows easy maintenance
and further development. The Ph.D. thesis can be found <a href="{{
 STATIC_URL }}pdf/gustavoPhD2012.pdf">here</a>, which was selected to be
among the 5-10% best thesis written at EPFL in 2012 (<a href="{{
 STATIC_URL }}pdf/prixPhd.pdf">more info</a>). From Aug. 2012 to Aug.
2013 I worked as a Post-Doc Associated in Nuclear Science & Engineering
(<a href="http://web.mit.edu/nse">NSE</a>) at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology (<a href="http://www.mit.edu">MIT</a>) in
Cambridge/Boston area. The aim of the Post-Doc position was to benchmark
the boiling/condensation experimental database using a commercial
front-capturing code available in the laboratory. In Sep. 2013 I finally
returned to Brazil as Post-Doc assistent sponsored by the brazilian
agency CAPES/Ciencias sem Fronteiras - Young Talent Fellowship.
Currently I am adjunct professor in Mechanical Engineering at the State
University of Rio de Janeiro (<a href="http://www.uerj.br">UERJ</a>)
