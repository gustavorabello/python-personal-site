{% mark excerpt -%}

Increased functionality and power consumption of microdevices and high
power electronics has come at a cost: power dissipation and heating.
This heat must be dissipated to ensure reliable operation of such
devices in both earthly and reduced gravity environments (eg space
industry), without adversely affecting their performance. With a highly
competitive world market, worth tens of billions of Euros, it is
imperative for EU to gain a competitive position in this field
(currently led by USA and China).

The proposed work is an important step towards developing novel,
efficient and reliable thermal management via phase-change through
sustained international collaboration between top research groups in EU,
USA, Canada, Brazil, Japan and China. These include 17 experienced
researchers from University of Edinburgh, Shanghai Jiaotong University,
Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, University System of Maryland
Foundation, University of Nottingham, York University Toronto, Kyushu
University, Kobe University and Universidade do Estado do Rio de
Janeiro. These partners have complementary expertise in
microfabrication, surface characterisation, experimental techniques,
analytical and numerical modelling. The collaboration enables knowledge
transfer and access to unique facilities such as those at NASA, Intel,
Hua Wei, Siltech, Bombardier, Brazilian Furnas, Petrobras,
Eletronuclear, State Government of Rio de Janeiro, Brazilian agencies
for development (FINEP & FAPERJ), Hitachi, Toshiba, Mitsubishi, Kansai
Electric Power Co. and IBM, reinforcing the research standing of EU in
this crucial technological area. It also offers a unique opportunity for
training 20 early stage researchers in state-of-art experimental and
modelling techniques for phase-change and microfabrication. In addition
to regular consortium meetings, technical workshops and research
publications, we propose two summer schools at Shanghai (supported by
RCUK) and Lausanne and several exchange programmes to sustain long-term
interaction between the partners.
