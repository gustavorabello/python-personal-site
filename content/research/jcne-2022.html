{% mark excerpt -%}

Numerical simulation is an important tool to solve two-phase problems
found in many engineering problems. Therefore, a project in the thematic
line of multiphase flow simulation, which has important applications
in the area of petroleum, micro-reactors and biomechanics. The projectâ€™s
emphasis is on the development of numerical simulation methods based
on unstructured meshes, for flows that presents two or more distinct
phases with phase change.

The method proposed seek to combine flexibility and efficiency, in order
to make simulation of more complex phenomena, such as the formation and
evolution of hydrate particles in lines oil production submarines, flow
mode- ling with particulates, simulation of multiphase flows in
capillaries and cooling of high power electronic devices. The project
will be developed at COPPE/Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.
