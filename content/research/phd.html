{% mark excerpt -%}

The topic of the doctorate is two-phase flow and heat transfer in
microchannels. One of the major aspects of this thesis will be to extend
the single phase code (developed during the masters studies) and
implement two-phase and heat transfer bringing the surface tension
effects into the code for elongated bubble flows, annular flows and
bubbly flows (for both evaporating flows and perhaps also for some
condensing flows).

Both Finite Element Method (FEM) and the Arbitrary
Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) framework will be used to achieve such a task.
Another interesting aspect could be for an isolated bubble growing at a
wall in a cross-flow in a microchannel with down stream coalescence of
the train of departing bubbles. All these works are done in the Heat and
Mass Transfer Laboratory (LTCM) at the Swiss Federal Institute of
Technology in Lausanne (EPFL).
