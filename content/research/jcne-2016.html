{% mark excerpt -%}

The numerical simulation is a essential tool to troubleshoot multiphase
flows found in many physico-chemical processes, such as the oil and gas
extraction and processing, filling of hydroelectric reservoirs,
drug-eluting transport in biological systems and cooling of high
technology electronic components, all of them of utmost importance for
achieving technology and development to the State of Rio de Janeiro.

It is in this scope that the present project is part of, aimed at improving
and adding new features on a high perfor- mance platform of multiphase
flow simulation in geometries with high level of complexity. This tool
is able to predict in details physical phenomena hard to be observed
through Experimental and analytical reproduction, such as those found in
biological systems, more specifically in the transport substances that
can cause total or partial blockage of arteries undergoing stenting for
CAD treatment and cooling of electronic by analysis of multiphase flows
in parallel channels. Indicators of performance that will be used in the
project are based on publications produced by the professor/researcher
and subject to assessments of the scientific community.
