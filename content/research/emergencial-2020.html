{% mark excerpt -%}

This proposal aims to investigate the means of propagating of the
COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 through two complementary approaches between
individuals and groups of individuals during social contact. A small
scale model is proposed to investigate the behavior of salivary droplets
between individuals who may be contaminated by orally transmitted
diseases.

At the same time, a study on contamination of groups of individuals
through population dynamics will be carried out for macroscopic
understanding of epidemic behavior disease. It is within this scope that
the present project is inserted, aiming at improvement of a
computational studies platform, supported by FAPERJ in several ongoing
projects, using numerical simulation high level in order to characterize
particle dynamics and the dynamics of infection through contact between
groups of people from the same locality and between regions of Brazil.
The different scales of these two approaches will allow a detailed
understanding of the rapid spread of COVID-19 viral load and the
effectiveness of containment effects of the disease in our society.
