{% mark excerpt -%}

The numerical simulation is an important tool to solve two-phase flow
problems found in several engineering processes, such as oil drilling,
reservoir filling and cooling of electronic components. In medicine,
it has been shown an efficient tool for the study of biological
problems, such as corneal replacement, the latter of great importance
for patients in need of transplant.

It is in this scope that this project retains, for the development and
improvement of a two-phase study platform using high level numerical
simulations, in order to characterize the dynamics of bubbles in outer
layers of the cular body whe the replacement of the cornea is required.
Through the Big Bubble technique, where bubbles are inserted into the
outer layers of the eyeball to corneal detachment.
