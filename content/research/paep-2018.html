This document presents the proposal of the Organizing Committee of the
4th Workshop on Advances in CFD and Modeling of Interface Dynamics in
Capillary Two-Phase Flows, to be held in the city of Rio de Janeiro - RJ
in May 2019. It is a worldwide event, held in continuously since 2015
(Lausanne - Switzerland), and the next one in Kobe - Japan in October
2018, where the current workshop will be held in Brazil for the first
time in 2019.

This workshopâ€™s subject is related to the important area
of multiphase flow with applications to engineering and other related
areas. The estimated number of participants is limited to 60 graduated
students. The team of this workshop is composed of by researchers and
professors from international universities of high recognition in acade-
mics and research, from Japan, England and Switzerland, as well as from
Rio de Janeiro. The areas of knowledge related to the event are:
Variational Principles and Numerical Methods (3.05.01.04-0), Fluid
Mechanics (3.05.01.02-4), Heat Transfer (3.05.01.01-6), Gas Dynamics
(3.05.01.03-2) and Thermodynamics (3.05.02.01-2).
