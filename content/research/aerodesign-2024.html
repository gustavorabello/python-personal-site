Founded in 2001, Minerva Aerodesign is an academic competition team
dedicated to participating in aerodesign competitions promoted by the
Society of Automotive Engineers. Its mission is to deepen technical
knowledge, develop management skills and foster innovation through the
design and construction of small unmanned aerial vehicles for
competitions. Throughout the year, at SAE Brasil Aerodesign, the team
develops a prototype aimed at cargo transportation.

Through research,
testing and simulations, an optimized model of the aircraft is obtained.
Using studied materials and construction techniques, prototypes are
built and taken to São José dos Campos Airport to compete with more than
60 teams from Brazil and other countries.
