{% mark excerpt -%}

The numerical simulation is an important tool to solve two-phase flow
problems found in several engineering processes, such as oil drilling,
reservoir filling and cooling of electronic components. In medicine, it
has been shown an efficient tool for the study of biological problems,
such as corneal replacement, the latter of great importance for patients
in need of transplant.

It is in this scope that this project retains,
for the development and improvement of a two-phase study platform using
high level numerical simulations, in order to characterize the dynamics
of bubbles in outer layers of the ocular body when the replacement of the
cornea is required. Through the Big Bubble technique, where bubbles are
inserted into the outer layers of the eyeball to corneal detachment.
