From 2007 to mid-2008 I worked as a young researcher in the Group for
Study and Simulations of Reservoir Filling (GESAR) . This one-year
experience brought me the necessary skills for large code development,
since the multi-disciplinary project required experience in many
different areas such as engineering, biology, chemistry and mathematics.
The project consisted in numerical simulation of hydropower reservoirs
filling.

The Navier-Stokes's equation was used to describe the behaviour
of the interaction between the surrounded nature (nutrients, vegetation,
chemical components) and the flow itself. The previous master's code was
improved and massively tested against important nature phenomenas which
occurs due to the filling of large Brazilian reservoirs. The Finite
Element Method had been used for the mathematical discretization using
triangular (2D) and tetrahedral (3D) elements. The final result is the
development of a powerful software able to predict the natural variables
found in a generic hydropower reservoirs filling.
