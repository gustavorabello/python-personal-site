{% mark excerpt -%}

The numerical simulation is an important tool to solve two-phase flow
problems found in several physical processes, such as oil drilling,
reservoir filling, hemodynamic and cooling of electronic components, the
latter of great importance for describing problems related to controling
flow and temperature conditions for new generation of stack processors.

It is in this scope that this project retains, for the development and
improvement of a two- phase study platform using high level numerical
simulation, described in modern language environment using
object-oriented programming, in order to study in details fluid flow
problems in microscale, specifically the characterization of flows in
microchannels with different cross section geometry. At the end of the
project, the objective is to comprehend, in detail, the dynamics of
bubbles in different types of channels to enhance the efficient
dissipation of heat in compact processing units (CPU). Indicators of
performance that will be used in the project are based on publications
produced by the professor/researcher and subject to assessments
scientific community.
