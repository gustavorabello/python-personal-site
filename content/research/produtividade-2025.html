{% mark excerpt -%}

Numerical simulation is an important tool to solve two-phase problems
found in many engineering problems. Therefore, a project in the thematic
line of multiphase flow simulation, which has important
applications in the area of petroleum, micro-reactors
and biomechanics. The project's emphasis is on the development
of numerical simulation methods based on unstructured meshes, for flows
that presents two or more distinct phases.

The method proposed seek to
combine flexibility and efficiency, in order to make simulation of more
complex phenomena, such as the formation and evolution of
hydrate particles in lines oil production submarines, flow
modeling with particulates and simulation of multiphase flows
in capillaries. The project will be developed at COPPE/Federal
University of Rio de Janeiro.
