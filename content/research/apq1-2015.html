{% mark excerpt -%}

The numerical simulation is an important tool to solve biphasic problems
encountered in various physical processes, such as oil drilling,
reservoir filling, cooling of electronic components and substances
transport processes in biological systems, the latter being of great
importance for the description of problems related to coronary artery
disease (CAD).

It is in this scope that the present project is part, for
the development and improvement of a two-phase study platform using
numerical simulation of high-level, described in modern numerical tools
in an environment-oriented programming language objects in order to
study in detail flows found in biological problems, specifically in the
transport of substances that can cause partial or complete blockage of
arteries undergoing stenting for treatment of CAD. The performance
indicators that will be used in the project are based on publications
produced by the teacher / researcher and submitted to the scientific
community assessments.
