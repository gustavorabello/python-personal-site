This pilot project aims to improve the quality of undergraduate teaching 
in the EEK-597 course offered by the Mechanical Engineering Department 
(DEM) through the use of active learning methodologies in engineering 
problems in an engaging classroom environment, where students are 
continuously stimulated to develop industrial-level solutions.

The course prepares future engineers for a more competitive job market
where efficient use of computers is essential for professional
development. Through practical techniques for developing numerical codes
applied to solving physical problems, the future engineer will gain
high-level knowledge for analysis, diagnosis, and decision-making in
various practical situations encountered in the daily life of a
professional. The resources learned in the classroom will directly serve
for executing complex tasks in industry, where numerical analysis is
fundamental.
