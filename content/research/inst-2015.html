Multiphase flow are characterized by the presence of an interface
separating two substances which may or may not be in the same phase. The
presence of such physical interface increases the complexity of the flow
and as a direct consequence, much of the multiphase problems encountered
with difficult engineering solution.

Undeniably, the numerical simulation is an important tool to solve
multiphase problems encountered in oil extraction processes, reservoir
filling, cooling of electronic components and food synthesis processes
in biochemical systems. It is in this scope that the present project is
part, for the development and improvement of a multiphase study platform
using numerical simulation of high-level, described in modern numerical
tools in an environment-oriented programming language objects. The
objective is to use this numerical simulator for the detailed study of
multiphase flow found in relevant engineering problems to the research
lines of the Department of Mechanical Engineering at UERJ. The
performance indicators that will be used in the project are based on
publications produced by the teacher / researcher and submitted to the
scientific community assessments.
