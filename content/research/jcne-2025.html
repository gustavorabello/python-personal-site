This project proposes the development of a novel numerical framework to simu-
late interface dynamics, heat and mass transfer, and coalescence of multiple
bubbles in two-phase flows with complex geometries. Using modern programming
languages such as Python and C++, the method employs High-Order Finite Ele-
ment Methods in 2D and 3D, Moving Meshes, High-Order Semi-Lagrangian schemes,
Interface Tracking, Adaptive Mesh Refinement, and Variable Time Stepping.

It also integrates scientific libraries for efficient solution of linear
systems using iterative methods and preconditioners. The formulation is based
on the Ar- bitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) framework, allowing advanced
simulations of fluid-structure interactions. The results demonstrate high
performance in capturing complex interface motion, with potential applications
in cooling systems, naval vehicles, biofuel reactors, and turbomachinery, while
also contributing to a deeper understanding of coalescence in two-phase
systems. The project will be develo- ped at COPPE/Federal University of Rio de
Janeiro.
