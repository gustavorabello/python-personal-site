# ABSTRACT:

A laboratory study of the turbulent boundary layer which develops over
surface that present an abrupt change in roughness is made. The cases of
a uniformly smooth surface and three kinds of different roughness
surfaces are investigated. The tree forest dispositions are,
respectively, in line forest, where the top of trees is lined up with
the smooth surface; open forest, where the base of trees is lined up
with the smooth surface; and closed forest, equally represented for open
forest with the difference of the aluminum plate inclusion made use
transversally to the long of the wind tunnel. The objective of this work
is analise, experimentally, the caracteristic of forest atmospheric
flow. Velocity profile, skin-fiction coeficient, internal boundary layer
thickness, Clauserâ€™s factor and the distribution of integral momentum
are presente. The method of integral balance was used to investigate the
decurrent phenomena of the simulation of forest in wind tunnel.
