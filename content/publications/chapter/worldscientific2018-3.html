# ABSTRACT:

A moving mesh method is presented for the numerical simulation of
two-phase flows in 2D and axisymmetric geometries. The incompressible
Navier–Stokes equations for two fluid phases are discretized with the
finite element method (FEM) in the arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian (ALE)
framework. In the context of the FEM, several triangular elements are
described, which satisfy the inf-sup compatibility condition and can
thus be employed for two-phase flow simulations without any additional
stabilization terms. The interface between the phases is defined
explicitly by an interface adapted mesh consisting of line segments,
which are part of the unstructured triangular mesh. This allows for a
sharp representation of the interface as a discontinuous transition
region between the different fluids. Surface tension is modeled as a
volume force and it is discretized in the same manner as the pressure
gradient, thus allowing to fulfill an exact balance between these two
terms. The important issue of suppressing parasitic currents in
computational two-phase flow is addressed by showing that the present
approach almost achieves this goal for a spherical droplet moving in a
constant velocity field. An exact computation of the interface curvature
is shown to be a necessity for the spurious currents to be numerically
zero. The adaptive mesh technique developed to preserve mesh quality
with the moving interface is described and mesh refinement strategies
are also discussed. Accuracy and robustness of the present method are
demonstrated on several test problems. Finally, an application of the
method to a capillary two-phase flow is presented in the simulation of a
slug flow in a microchannel, where the results are compared to
experimental data.
