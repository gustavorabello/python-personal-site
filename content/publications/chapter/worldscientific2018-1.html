# ABSTRACT:

This chapter presents a collection of test cases for two-phase flows
using the Arbitrary Lagrangianâ€“Eulerian (ALE) framework through the
Finite element method (FEM). Using an explicit description of the
interface between fluids and moving the mesh nodes according to the flow
velocity has shown successfully the advantages of the ALE description.
Complex geometries can be handled with relative ease using FEM as will
be seen withing this chapter. It is shown that such a methodology can be
employed to study accurately many problems, such as oil extraction and
refinement in the petroleum and gas industry, design of refrigeration
systems, modeling of biological systems and efficient cooling of
electronics. The numerical results obtained will be described in
details.
