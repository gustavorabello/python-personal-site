# ABSTRACT:

This chapter presents a series of new methods used in the numerical
modeling of two-phase flows based on the arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian
(ALE) formulation and the finite element method (FEM). Theoretical
considerations concerning the imposition of periodic boundary conditions
through a variationally consistent framework, as well as their
implementation techniques for a class of 3D two-phase flows are
provided. Mesh design tools, pre-processing tasks, adaptive refinement,
gradient-based finite element spaces and their applicability in the
modeling of bubble flows are introduced. Cases highlighting single and
multiple bubbles arranged as slug and annular flow patterns are
idealized, as well as pressure gradient- and gravity-driven flows.
Supplementary comments point out ongoing and future challenges relating
to the numerical development of ALE–FEM-based strategies.
