# ABSTRACT:

A modern numerical method is described to study two-phase flows for
single and multiple bubbles in complex geometries. The fluid flow
equations are developed in 3-dimensions based on the Arbitrary
Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation (ALE) and the Finite Element Method
(FEM), creating a new two-phase method with an improved model for the
liquid-gas interface. A successful adaptive mesh update procedure is
also proposed for effective management of the mesh at the two-phase
interface to remove, add and repair surface elements, since the
computational mesh nodes move according to the flow. The Lagrangian
description explicitly defines the two-phase interface position by a set
of interconnected nodes which ensures a sharp representation of the
boundary, including the role of the surface tension. The new methodology
proposed for computing the curvature leads to accurate results with
moderate programming effort and computational cost, which can be also
applied to different methods with explicitly description of the
interface.
