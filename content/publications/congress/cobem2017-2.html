# ABSTRACT:

The present work aims at developing a computational framework to simulate coronary artery flows in axisym- metric coordinates. An accurate method capable of capturing the flow dynamics is strictly required. In this article an Finite Element Method (FEM) is used to solve the equations governing the motion of the blood flow found in coronary artery as incompressible fluid. An in-house code, previously implemented by Anjos (2012); Anjos et al. (2014), is further developed and presently extended first to better model coronary flows.
