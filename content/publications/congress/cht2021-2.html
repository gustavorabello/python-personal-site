# ABSTRACT:

This paper describes a finite element solution for a two-phase flow
problem, where the fluid mesh and the interface mesh are decoupled. One
single phase example is shown to validate the finite element code, and
two two-phase flow examples are presented, the static droplet and the
oscillating droplet, with air and water as fluids. Examples work as
expected and show that the methodology is valid and suitable for
two-phase flows.
