# ABSTRACT:

According to the World Health Organization, more people die annually
from the cardiovascular disease (CVD) that from any other cause in the
world. About 44% of these deaths were due to coronary heart disease
(CHD) in the United States. This work aims to develop a FE code for 2D
Axisymmetric Navier-Stokes with species transport equation using
semi-Lagrangian scheme and to know how occurs the dynamics of blood flow
in coronary artery with atherosclerosis and with stents struts placed.
The blood was modeled as single-phase, incompressible and newtonian
fluid, the diffusion coefficient was considered as constant. Due to
coupling between velocity field and pressure field, the different
triangular elements was used, where the linear element was used for
pressure field and the MINI element was used for velocity field. The
equations were discretized in space by Galerkin formulation and in time,
the semi-Lagrangian scheme was used to discretized the material
derivative using first order backward difference scheme. The dynamics of
blood flow and species transport in coronary artery was investigated in
a complex geometry, that it was called the Curved Channel with Stent,
where the atherosclerosis was modeled using a sinusoidal equation to
model 40% of channel obstruction. The Reynolds number was calculated
using the blood parameters and the Schmidt number was simulated for
several cases.
