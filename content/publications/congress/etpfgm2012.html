# ABSTRACT:

Numerical simulation is employed to simulate two-phase flow phenomena
using the continuum method for surface tension modeling [1]. The pure
Lagrangian approach moves the mesh points with respect to the flow
field, thus the particle's positions in the next time step are precisely
calculated. In interface flows, the moving mesh approach leads to a
highly deformable grid, which quickly adversely influences the quality
of the computational elements. On the other hand, besides the fact that
a fixed grid formulation allows an easier treatment of complex interface
motion, the pure Eulerian description presents numerical difficulties
due to the nonsymmetric character of the convection operator. To
overcome these limitations, a generalized description capable of
combining the best aspects of both classical descriptions is employed,
namely the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) framework [2]. The set of
equations are based on the Navier-Stokes formulation but with the
relative mesh velocity included in the convective term. By varying a
single parameter, the formulation can be set to a fixed or a complete
moving mesh technique. Another important issue in two-phase flow
modeling is the definition of the interface between the fluids. In the
classical Eulerian formulation, the interface is described implicitly by
an equation which is convected by the fluid flow. Due to the
discretization of such an equation, numerical diffusion may lead to low
accuracies of the calculated surface tension term. In this work, the
interface between fluids is described explicitly in a Lagrangian way by
points and computational elements, thus a sharp and precise
representation is successfully achieved. This geometrical procedure also
ensures undesirable modes and spurious oscillations are damped out, thus
leading to the convergence of the results. A Laplacian smoothing
operator is applied to the whole grid and to the surface mesh to keep
the points homogeneously distributed, thereby avoiding large
concentrations of points in one specific region. Unfortunately, only
using the Laplacian operator is not enough to preserve the mesh quality,
thus other common geometric procedures also need to be applied [3]. The
new methodology proposed here to simulate two-phase flows provides good
accuracy to describe the interfacial forces and bubble dynamics. The
employed formulation, the interface representation and the results will
be presented. Focus will be on the treatment of the surface elements and
how to preserve the mesh quality and the element aspect ratios.
Furthermore, a 3D microscale simulation of a bubble flow will be
presented.
