# ABSTRACT:

Nowadays, air pollution is one of the greatest problems that humankind
is trying to mitigate. Since vehicle emissions are a main source of air
pollution main causes, many efforts have been made to control this
problem. A specific case is vehicles with diesel engines, which use a
device called Diesel Particulate Filter, or just DPF, to control the
exhausted particulates. It is important to study the behavior of air and
particulates inside this device to better understand the problem’s
physics, making it possible to improve it. Then, one way to achieve that
effectively is by carrying out numerical simulations. In this scenario,
this work aims to develop a computational code that can accurately
calculate the particulates' behavior along with the flow. In order to do
that, this case, which is a multiphase flow problem with air and
particulates, is modeled in such a way that the air is treated from an
Eulerian point of view through the Navier-Stokes equations while the
particulates are treated in a Lagrangian way by using Newton’s second
law. Finally, the developed code is used to simulate a case found in the
literature, allowing the results obtained in this work to be compared
with the literature ones, making it possible to verify the code’s
reliability.
