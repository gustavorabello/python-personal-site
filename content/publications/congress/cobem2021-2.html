# ABSTRACT:

In this research, finite element numerical simulation is used to
describe bubble dynamics in two-phase flows. The accurate simulation of
interface dynamics in two-phase flows is of crucial relevance for
numerical analysis of two-phase heat transfer. The simulation is
achieved by solving the incompressible Navier-stokes and energy
conservation equations for two-phase flows, discretized through the
Finite Element Method (FEM), where the interface and the fluid meshes
are not explicitly connected. Two meshes are used, a fixed one for the
fluid flow, and a moving mesh which describes the interface movement
between fluids. Fluid properties are smoothed out to avoid numerical
instabilities in the transition from one fluid to another. Surface
tension is implemented according to the well-known continuum surface
tension model, using the Laplace-Beltrami operator for curvature
computation. Surface tension force is added explicitly to the Navier-
Stokes equations as a volume force through the gradient of a Heaviside
function, therefore the momentum equation is solved using a one-fluid
approach. To prove that such an interesting numerical scheme is stable
and accurate, we present two test cases, consisting of a bubble rising
due to gravity. The first case explores a small difference in viscosity
and density and the second one presents a more aggressive difference in
properties across both fluids, and a smaller surface tension, exposing a
more difficult simulation. Both cases resulted in stable bubbles, with
qualitative results agreeable to the literature.
