# ABSTRACT:

Bubbles and drops dynamics through capillaries of variable cross-section
still remains of considerable importance in two-phase flows through
porous media. Experimental studies are found in the literature where the
motion of immiscible bubbles in different fluids is investigated.
Recovery of oil by chemical flooding, biological processes and crude oil
transportation in through pipelines are examples of industry-related
applications. We seek to study numerically the effects of the surface
tension, bubble dynamics and channel geometry for two-phase flows in
channels with variable cross-section using a moving mesh/boundary domain
scheme, which dramatically shortens the domain length. Such a scheme
moves the computational boundary nodes according to the variable
cross-section of a given problem. In this work, we present several
physical problems where the cross-sections change periodically or
arbitrarily according to the geometry. The new methodology proposed to
simulate two-phase flows in variable cross-sectioned channels shows good
accuracy to describe interface forces and bubble dynamics in different
complex geometries with moving boundaries.
