# ABSTRACT:

The bag filter is an essential component in various industrial
operations, used for the removal of solid particles. These particles can
vary in size and composition, often being pollutants or waste that need
to be controlled to ensure air quality, worker safety, and compliance
with environmental regulations. Proper management of pressure drop in
the system is necessary for bag filters to function correctly;
otherwise, proper filtration will not occur. Therefore, understanding
and quantifying pressure drop in filtration is essential to ensure its
effectiveness. However, measuring and evaluating pressure drop in bag
filters pose complex challenges, especially due to their use in large
assemblies within the same system and the accumulation of dust, which
can lead to clogging. Therefore, it is necessary to use an effective
methodology that allows for an efficient understanding of pressure drop
in these filters. Thus, the main objective of this work was to validate
the use of the Darcy-Forchheimer model in a CFD analysis of bag filters,
comparing the pressure drop results with experimental data from a
reference study. To compare these data, the geometry and conditions of
the experimental study were replicated in the CFD analysis, with the
same inlet flow and outlet pressure parameters. A mesh convergence
analysis was also performed using the GCI method. The analysis was
conducted with single-phase, incompressible, steady, fully developed,
and isothermal flow for different air speeds. Different turbulence
models were evaluated to verify which one best represented the flow
characteristics. The fundamental equations governing the flow were
numerically solved using the OpenFOAM software. The different pressure
drop data obtained from the analysis were compared with experimental
data. Altogether, it was found that the pressure drop values compared to
the experimental measurements validated the model, demonstrating a
similar trend with increasing velocities. Additionally, a variation in
the pressure field along the length of the filter was observed.
Thereupon, the effectiveness of the methodology in quantifying and
analyzing pressure drop in bag filters was demonstrated.
