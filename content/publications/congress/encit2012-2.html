# ABSTRACT:

We propose a numerical model to obtain results for the velocity and
concentration profiles close to semi-spherical rotating electrodes in
electrochemical cells. The profiles refer to nondimensional velocity
components along the radial direction, for straight lines ranging from
angles with the rotating axis 0, angle, pi/2 obtained by solving the
Navier-Stokes equations using the finite element method. The
discretization of the domain is made with an object oriented approach.
Spatial discretization of diffusive terms and the pressure is made by
the Galerkin method. For the material derivative we use a
semi-lagrangian method.
