# ABSTRACT:

The present work aims at developing a computational framework to
simulate blood flow in coronary artery with drug-eluting stent placed
using Streamfunction-Vorticity Formulation in a ALE-FE approach with
Semi-Lagrangian Scheme. The blood was modeled as single-phase,
incompressible and newtonian fluid and the Navier-Stokes equation in an
Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian description (ALE) is shown according to
the stream-vorticity formulation with species transport equation. The
Finite Element Method (FEM) is used to solve the governing equations
where the Galerkin formulation was used to discretized the equations in
space and the semi-Lagrangian scheme was used to discretized the
material derivative using first order backward difference scheme. The
linear systems was solved using Conjugate Gradient Method and the
preliminary results are shown.
