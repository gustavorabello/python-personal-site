# ABSTRACT:

Dissolution in the polymer coating and specific binding in the artery
wall play an important role in anisotropic transport of the
antiproliferative/anti-inflammatory drugs. In this work, we consider the
model of dissolution, transport and binding of sirolimus on an
axisymmetric domain representing the polymer coating layer and the
porous artery wall in the vicinity of a stent strut. The Finite Element
Method (FEM) is used to discretize the porous media equations by an
interconnected unstructured triangular mesh and an improved anistropic
model is employed to accurately capture the correct effect of the
diffusion tension seem in the sirolimus concentration distribution.
Finally, we present the new results obtained to the characterization of
the dynamics of the porous arterial wall with binding in drug-eluting
stents.
