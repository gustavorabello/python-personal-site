# ABSTRACT:

The goal of this research is to accurately depict two-phase dynamics,
using axisymmetric finite element numer- ical simulation. To achieve
this goal, the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for two-phase
flows, are solved through the Finite Element Method (FEM), using a
two-phase separation strategy where there are two distinct meshes, one
for the two-phase fluid and one for the interface. The mini element is
utilized in order to respect the LBB condition, and avoid artificial
stabilization terms in the fluid motion equations. The non-linear
convective term on the Navier-Stokes equation is solved by applying a
first order semi-Lagrangian scheme. Of the two meshes used, the fluid
mesh has several finite element nodes and is fixed, not requiring any
re-meshing or interference during the simulation. The interface mesh
moves and requires re-meshing, but has quite fewer points relative to
the fluid mesh, and so the movement and re-meshing computational costs
are negligible. The fluid and interface meshes are decoupled; the only
link between them is the inter- face mesh position update, based on the
velocity fields obtained from the fluid mesh, through the finite element
solution. Fluid properties are smoothed over a defined thickness of the
fluid interfaces, thus avoiding numerical instability. Surface tension
is implemented using the well-known continuum surface tension model,
using the Laplace-Beltrami operator for curvature computation. As
validation for the discussed approach, three test cases will be
presented. The static droplet, where a droplet stays still while surface
tension is balanced by pressure; the oscillating droplet, where a
droplet starts in elliptical shape, and oscillates; and the gravity
driven bubbles, where bubbles rises inside a quiescent fluid, dominated
by gravity force, all presenting satisfactory results according to the
available literature.
