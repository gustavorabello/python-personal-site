# ABSTRACT:

The stream function-vorticity formulation is a useful alternative to
solving the Navier-Stokes equations in two dimensional domain. One of
its major difficulties is the lack of boundary conditions for vorticity,
and several schemes are proposed to satisfy such a condition. In this
paper we propose a finite element scheme for solving the couple problem
of the stream function- vorticity formulation using linear triangle
elements. A possible application of the method is also demonstrated
using the calculated velocity field from the formu- lation in the heat
transport equation to study the temperature distribution in a
incompressible single-phase fluid medium. The results obtained were
satisfactory when using low to moderate Reynolds number.
