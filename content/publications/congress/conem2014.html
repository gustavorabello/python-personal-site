# ABSTRACT:

This work applies a finite element method (FEM) approach with periodic
boundary conditions to the Navier- Stokes equations for an
incompressible fluid moving inside a planar hexagonally-arranged domain.
We highlight the usability of a model which decomposes the total
pressure into a linear part and a periodic component to ensure the
maintenance of mass flow across the domain. Besides, we apply a strategy
to eliminate degrees of freedom directly inside the global matrix, so
enforcing the periodicity for Dirichlet and Neumann conditions
accordingly. Numerical simulations under low Reynolds number are
presented for staggered and nonstaggered array configurations.
Additionally, the periodic implementation is verified in contrast to the
classical analytical solution of a Taylor vortex, thus providing good
representation of the flow desired.
