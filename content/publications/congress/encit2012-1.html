# ABSTRACT:

For many years the stability of rotating disk flow has been studied
following the evolution of small perturbations superposed to the
classical von Karman's solution, von Karman (1921, ZAMM, Vol. 19, pp.
233-252), Oliveira (Ms.C dissertation 2011, COPPE/UFRJ). These equations
were obtained assuming an infinite domain. In this condition side wall
effects are negligible Zandbergen (1987, Fluid Mechanics, Vol. 19, pp.
465-491), Barcia (2000, Journal of The Electrochemical Society, Vol.
155, No. 5, pp. 424-427), Anjos (Ms.C dissertation 2007, COPPE/UFRJ). In
the present work we consider the effect of a finite domain on von
Kármán’s solution, aiming to find the minimum dimensions of the
electrochemical cell, bellow which the assumption of von Kármán flow,
with nondimensional velocity profiles dependes on the axial coordinate
only, no longer holds.
