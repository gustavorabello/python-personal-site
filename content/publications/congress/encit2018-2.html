# ABSTRACT:

Conjugated heat transfer problems have an extensive number of
applications because a lot of times it is neces- sary to understand how
heat convection in a fluid influences the temperature in solid regions.
The stream function-vorticity formulation is a useful alternative to
solving the Navier-Stokes equations in two dimensional domain. One of
its major difficulties is the lack of boundary conditions for vorticity,
and several schemes are proposed to satisfy such a condition. In this
paper we propose a finite element scheme for solving the couple problem
of the stream function-vorticity formu- lation using linear triangle
elements. A possible application of the method is also demonstrated
using the calculated velocity field from the formulation in the heat
transport equation to study the temperature distribution in a
incompressible single-phase fluid medium as a conjugate heat transfer
problem. The results obtained were satisfactory when using low Reynolds
number.
