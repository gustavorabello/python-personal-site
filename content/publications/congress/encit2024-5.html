# ABSTRACT:

Biofuels are a type of fuel of natural or biological origin. It has
become very popular because it is a clean and renewable energy, unlike
traditional fossil fuels. Biodiesel is a monoalkyl ester obtained by
reacting triacylglycerols (from plants, used cooking oil, animal fats)
with an alcohol (usually methanol or ethanol). One of the main biofuels
available today is biodiesel. In addition to other important uses,
biodiesel is mainly used in vehicle fuels, mixed with regular diesel
made from petroleum. Microreactor technology, an important method of
process intensification, offers numerous potential benefits for the
process industries. Two-phase reactions with mass transfer limitations
can be carried out advantageously on a small scale in a slow two-phase
flow microreactor. In this type of reactor, alternating uniform pieces
(slugs) of the two-phase reaction mixture exhibit areas of interphase
mass transfer and well-defined flow patterns. Circulations within the
slug are not fully understood and require systematic numerical study and
the development of refined mathematical models. The aim of this work is
to study the behavior of two-phase flow through a capillary microreactor
for biodiesel production using the homogeneous flow model where the
two-phases travel at equal velocities and mix well, therefore they can
be treated as if there is only one phase. A computational fluid dynamics
(CFD) approach is then used to numerically simulate this type of flow.
The flows are modeled by the two-dimensional incompressible
Navier-Stokes equations written through the streamfunction-vorticity
formulation, which are approximated by the Finite Element Method, using
a mesh of quadrilateral elements. A computer code based on this
methodology was developed and a verification process was carried out
before it was used to simulate the problem. The code was then used to
simulate the flow in microreactors, and the results were compared with
those found in the literature, making it possible to verify that the
methodology presented is indeed capable of correctly simulating flows
inside a microreactor.
