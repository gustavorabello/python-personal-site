# ABSTRACT:

In Engineering, the study of microscale two-phase flows is important in
many areas such as micro-reactors and cooling of electronics. A full
description of flow behavior in some situations is hard to predict
experimentally, therefore a different approach is necessary to study
particular cases and investigate, in detail, the flow field. Many
authors have used different approaches to represent the interface
between two fluids, varying from front-capturing to front-tracking
methodology. These techniques, used separately, have pros and cons
related to mass conservation, interface representation and topological
changes in the interface. Thus, hybrid methods are becoming popular to
overcome the disadvantages and to describe accurately the surface
tension. In this work direct numerical simulation is employed to
simulate two-phase flow phenomena considering the well known continuum
method for surface tension modeling proposed by [1]. The Navier-Stokes
equations are modeled in a different manner using the Arbitrary
Lagrangian Eulerian Technique (ALE) and discretized by the finite
element method. By applying the ALE technique to two-phase flows, we are
able to use the best aspects of both reference frames [2], allowing us
to track the interface in the Lagrangian fashion whilst keeping the mesh
fixed in a Eulerian point of view relative to the remaining flow field.
This is particularly interesting when investigating for bubble/bubble
and bubble/wall interactions. The unstructured moving mesh is
regularized at each time step through a Laplacian smoothing operator
which tends to distribute the mesh nodes optimally in each time step.
This technique improves the accuracy of the method resulting in uniform
elements throughout the mesh. The curvature calculation is obtained
geometrically as the variation of the normal or the tangent vector along
the curve that defines the interface [3]. The computation of the
curvature is easy to implement since the interface between the fluids is
represented by computational nodes that are convected with the interface
leading to reduced mass conservation errors [4] and to low-cost
computational efforts because the calculation is done only at the
interface nodes. The results obtained so far have been compared to
those found in the literature. This showed that the methodology proposed
to simulate two-phase flows provides good accuracy to describe the
interfacial forces and bubble dynamics. A 3D microscale simulation of
bubble flow will be presented.
