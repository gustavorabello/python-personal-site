# ABSTRACT:

Particle-laden multiphase flow is an important subject of study in fluid
mechanics. In this work, the particle emission from biofuel production
and storage is analyzed and simulated, with respect to the different
geometries associated with the fluid dynamics and dispersion of said
pollutants, in order to obtain the main effects of such transportation
into the atmosphere, that may cause environmental and health damages.
The continuous phase is numerically simulated through the Navier-Stokes
equations, for which the results are in complete accordance to the ones
presented in the literature. As for the solid dispersion, an
Euler-Lagrange analysis is made, which provides a better understanding
of each particle trajectory. A numerical and optimized simulator is
completely built by means of the Finite Element Method (FEM) and the
results are obtained for different geometries. A validation of the model
is first made with a classical fluid mechanics problem: the lid driven
cavity, for both quadratic and MINI interpolations. A second domain is
simulated to analyze particlesâ€™ interaction with a fluid expansion and
also with heat transfer is introduced to the problem. All the results
and comparisons are shown and discussed throughout this document.
