# ABSTRACT:

A numerical method is described to study two-phase flows for single and
multiple bubbles with phase change. The fluid flow equations are based
on the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation (ALE) and the Finite
Element Method (FEM), creating a new two-phase method with an improved
model for the liquid-gas interface in microchannels. A successful
adaptive mesh update procedure is also described for effective
management of the mesh at the two-phase interface to remove, add and
repair surface elements, since the computational mesh nodes move
according to the flow. The Lagrangian description explicitly defines the
two-phase interface position by a set of interconnected nodes which
ensures a sharp representation of the boundary, including the role of
the surface tension. The methodology proposed for computing the
curvature leads to accurate results with moderate programming effort and
computational cost and it can also be applied to different
configurations with an explicit description of the interface. Such a
methodology can be employed to study accurately many problems such as
oil extraction and refinement in the petroleum area, design of
refrigeration systems, modelling of biological systems and efficient
cooling of electronics for computational purposes, being the latter the
aim of this research. The obtained numerical results will be described,
therefore proving the capability of the proposed new methodology.
