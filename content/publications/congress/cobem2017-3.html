# ABSTRACT:

 The safety and efficacy of Drug-eluting stents is strongly influenced
by the transport of the antiproliferative/anti- inflammatory drugs in
the arterial wall. Dissolution in the polymer coating and specific
binding in the artery wall play an important role in the process. We
consider the model of dissolution, transport and binding of sirolimus on
an axisymmetric domain representing the polymer coating layer and the
porous artery wall in the vicinity of a stent strut. We employ the FEM
on an unstructured mesh to discretise the governing equations. We employ
a nonlinear dissolution model for the dynamics in the coating, and a
nonlinear saturable binding model that includes both specific and
non-specific binding in the arterial wall as separate phases, as
proposed by McGinty and Pontrelli (2016). The arterial wall is
considered an anisotropic porous media, and the flow is considered to be
governed by Darcy flow. The permeability in the polymer coating is
considered to be very small, but finite. The endothelium lamina, where
present, is modelled as a no-flow boundary. The effect of slow and fast
release polymers is considered, showing that the time evolution of the
process can be efficiently controlled by the polymer diffusion
coefficient. However, the spatial distribution of the sirolimus is
greatly influenced by the flow and the arterial wall properties, being
therefore susceptible to patient health conditions.
