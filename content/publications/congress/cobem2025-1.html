# ABSTRACT:

The focus of this study is to evaluate flow-induced vibration in solid
structures for large deformations in the elastic regime. For that, the Finite
Element Analysis is a powerful numerical method that allows complex problems to
be modeled through a discretization of the domain. First, mass and momentum
equations are presented for both fluid and solid domains, along with their
respective constitutive relations. The semi-Lagrangian (SL) technique, where
unconditional stability is successfully achieved for the numerical solution in
different geometries, is developed. For the solid domain, a two-dimensional
approach was used with a quadratic triangular element mesh in a dynamic
simulation, with a linearization of the governing equation to apply the finite
element method. As for the fluid domain, a second order special convergence is
assured for velocity fields, since a quadratic + linear pair of triangular mesh
elements is used, fulfilling the well-known LBB condition. Since the movement
of the solid body in the fluid requires an adaptative technique to be employed
in the mesh, avoiding greater distorsion, the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian
method, also known as ALE, was used. For code verification, different cases
whose references are found in the literature were simulated for both fluid and
solid problems. Then, a Fluid-Structure Interaction is shown to investigate
vibration effects, such as the Von Mises stress.
