# ABSTRACT:

This paper presents a numerical approach to a model describing the
pattern formation by ion beam sputtering on a material surface. This
process is responsible for the appearance of unexpectedly organized
patterns, such as ripples, nanodots and hexagonal arrays of nanoholes. A
numerical analysis of preexisting patterns is proposed to investigate
surface dynamics, based on a model derived from a anisotropic damped
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, in a two dimen- sional surface with
periodic boundary conditions. While deterministic, its highly nonlinear
character gives a rich range of results, making it possible to describe
accurately different patterns. A finite-difference semi-implicit
splitting scheme is employed on the discretization of the governing
equation. Simulations were conducted with realistic coefficients related
to physical parameters (anisotropies, beam orientation, diffusion). The
stability of the numerical scheme is verified with time step and grid
spacing tests for the pattern evolution. Hexagonal patterns were
obtained from a monomodal initial condition for a higher value of the
damping coefficient a, while spatiotemporal chaos appeared for lower
values. The hexagonal ordered character of the structure was shown to be
directly proportional to a.
