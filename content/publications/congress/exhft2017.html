# ABSTRACT:

We present the results of a combined experimental and numerical study of
an air bubble rising in a vertical slowly diverging pipe in a stagnant
liquid. Initially, the bubble is confined in a cylindrical tube and
rises due to buoyancy in the same manner as a Taylor or elongated
bubble. When the bubble moves upwards, it reduces its vertical height
and the shape of the bubble transitions to a spherical cap bubble.
Different tests with various liquids are reported and a numer- ical
simulation using two-dimensional axisymmetric finite element method for
two-phase flow is reported. An adaptative mesh is also used to compute
the bubble dynamics. The experimental and the simulation results are
compared in terms of rising velocity and bubble aspect ratio. Our
results show a puzzling feature that is the bubble dynamics and topology
strongly depends on the initial conditions.
