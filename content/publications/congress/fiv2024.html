# ABSTRACT:

A new method to simulate fluid-structure interaction is proposed based
on the immersed Finite Element Method (iFEM), where no additional
external volume force is required to account for the structure-to-fluid
interaction. The incompressible fluid equations are written in the
Arbitrary Eularian-Lagrangian (ALE) framework, allowing the arbitrary
motion of the mesh nodes, whereas the solid motion is written in the
Lagrangian viewpoint and represented by an additional 2-dimensional
solid mesh carried out by the fluid flow. A Smooth Heaviside function is
used to define properties across the entire domain. Present test cases
show promising results when compared to standard benchmarks, especially
considering the simplicity of the proposed formulation to simulating
fluid-solid multiphase flows.
