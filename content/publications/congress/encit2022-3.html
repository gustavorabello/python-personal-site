# ABSTRACT:

Fluid dynamics with heat transfer problems have complex modeling
equations to be solved analytically. Thus, numerical methods, such as
the Finite Element Method (FEM), are broadly used in order to simulate
such phenomena for any geometry. The current study aims at simulating
flows in conjugated regions, where free-flow and porous regions are
present. The mathematical modeling is made through mass and momentum
equations discretized by the Finite Element Method (FEM) along with the
semi-lagrangian technique, where unconditional stability is successfully
achieved for the numerical solution in different geometries. The
Darcy-Forcheimer term is included in the classical Navier-Stokes equa-
tion, so that the resistance imposed by the porous medium is considered
in the pressure gradient. The quadratic triangle mesh element fulfil the
well-known LBB condition, assuring stability and 2nd order convergence,
when compared to sim- pler kinds of elements. Additionally, a mesh
convergence is made by comparing results with the literature for meshes
with different sizes. As to the temperature, an analysis on how the
porous medium interferes in the convective heat transfer is provided,
showing that, in conjugated flows, heat transfer is significantly
different from one region to the other, due to the effects of the porous
medium on convection. A pure convective case is also shown, in order to
demonstrate how temperature gradient, associated with a gravitational
field can induce convective streamlines in a confined region. The code
is written in Python in an optimized object-oriented programming, so
that refined meshes are easily used to simulate these phenomena,
providing more accurate results as the more elements are used. Also, an
optimized method for the semi-lagrangian was implemented, reducing
simulation time.
