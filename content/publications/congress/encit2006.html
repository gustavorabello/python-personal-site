# ABSTRACT:

A numerical model is proposed for solving the Navier-Stokes equations
coupled to the transport equation of a chemical species. The Finite
Element Method is employed in the problem discretization and the
object-oriented paradigm, in the development of the numerical code.
Spatial discretization of the diffusion and pressure terms is made
through the Galerkin method and the substantial derivative, through a
semi-Lagrangian technique, using a first-order backward Euler implicit
scheme. The linear system is solved through the discrete projection
method, based on LU decomposition.
