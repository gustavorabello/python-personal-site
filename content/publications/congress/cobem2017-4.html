# ABSTRACT:

This study was developed to theoretically size, through computational
tools, the efficiency of a real refrigeration system of simple
compression, working with refrigerant fluid R404a. The object of the
study is composed of a refrigeration chamber of the Novo Meriti
Frigorifico, located at Estrada Sao Joao Caxias, 1752, Sao Joao de
Meriti, RJ. Two identical refrigeration systems consisting of one
condensing unit and two evaporator units, the pipeline extensions of
each one is their own, are responsible, in parallel, by the cooling of
the chamber. The system was designed and selected to operate at a
maximum ambient temperature of 40 oC and provide an internal temperature
around 0 oC on cold room for 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. To the
modeling, the data were collected by measuring equipment at monthly
maintenance routines. With this, the computational modeling was designed
to offer, through equations of state, thermodynamic properties and
pressure drops, a working image for the main components of the system
for 7 months. Consequently, it was possible to perform an energy
analysis under the operating conditions in the months covered. This work
was possible through the collaboration between 3 companies and the
authors, they are Frigorifico Novo Meriti Ltda., RGT Engenharia de
Sistemas Ltda. and Heatcraft Brasil Ltda. These companies participate by
releasing information and data of the operation, maintenance and design,
respectively, plus support and authorization to stay in the
installations of the refrigerator units.
