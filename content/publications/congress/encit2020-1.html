# ABSTRACT:

This research aims at investigate the means of propagation of the
COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 between individuals during social contact. A small
scale model is proposed to investigate the behavior of salivary droplets
between individuals who may be contaminated by orally transmitted
diseases. This will allow a detailed understanding of the rapid spread
of COVID-19 viral load and the effectiveness of containment effects of
the disease in our society. The results point that saliva particles both
travel forward and stay in the air close to a person who coughs.
