# ABSTRACT:

The climate crisis has been pushing human activities to undergo a
decarbonization process in order to mitigate potential environmental
catastrophes in the short and long term future. In this scenario,
biofuels have gained promi- nence as a key strategy for decarbonization,
especially in Brazil, as they provoke fewer carbon dioxide emissions in
their combustion compared to fossil fuels. Furthermore, this potential
for reducing emissions can be increased through the adoption of more
efficient particulate filters in biofuel-powered machines, such as cars.
Therefore, this study aims to investigate different geometries of porous
channels of particulate filters and identify which geometric factors
make these filters more efficient, contributing to a better
understanding of the filtering phenomenon in this context. To accomplish
this goal, a portion of these filters was represented in a bidimensional
geometry and a matching unstructured mesh with three different types of
solid obstacles distributions representing the porous aspect of the
filters: aligned circular obstacles, misaligned circular obstacles and
circular obstacles with randomized positions. Each simulation considered
three vari- ations of obstacle radius, resulting in a total of nine
simulations. All of the simulations were run on an in-house Python code
developed specifically for this research, through the discretization of
the stream function-vorticity formulation using the Finite Element
Method. The important parameters analyzed in the current study were flow
speed, vorticity and stream function. From the results obtained, it was
observed that the size and distribution of circular obstacles, that
represented the porous medium within the channel, are variables that
influence the filtration efficiency of the filters. The simulations
identified distinct trends in the way these parameters influence the
filtration efficiency, and these trends were quantified using a
filtration quality parameter introduced in this study. Ultimately, this
research addresses the importance of opti- mizing particulate filter
design for biofuel-powered systems and aims to contribute to this effort
by offering insights into the relationship between the geometry of
particulate filters and their efficiency.
