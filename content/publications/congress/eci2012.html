# ABSTRACT:

We seek to study numerically two-phase flow phenomena with phase change
through the Finite Element Method (FEM) and the Arbitrary
Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) framework. This method is based on the
so-called ‘one-fluid’ formulation, thus only one set of equations is
used to describe the flow field at the vapour and liquid phases. The
equations are discretized on an unstructured tetrahedron mesh and the
interface between the phases is defined by a triangular surface, which
is a sub-set of the 3-dimensional mesh. The Navier-Stokes equation is
used to model the fluid flow and an additional energy equation is used
to model the heat transport between the phases. Such a methodology can
be employed to study accurately many problems such as oil extraction and
refinement in the petroleum area, design of refrigeration systems,
modelling of biological systems and efficient cooling of electronics for
computational purposes, which is the aim of this research. A comparison
of the obtained numerical results to the analytical solutions is
performed, thus proving the capability of the proposed new methodology.
