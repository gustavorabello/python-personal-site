# ABSTRACT:

The present study focuses in the simulation of pattern formation by ion
beam sputtering on a material surface. This process is responsible for
the appearance of unexpectedly organized patterns, such as ripples,
nanodots and hexagonal arrays of nanoholes. A numerical analysis of
preexisting patterns is proposed to investigate surface dynamics, based
on a model derived from a Kuramoto-Sivashinsky anisotropic equation, in
a two dimensional surface with periodic boundary conditions. While
deterministic, its highly nonlinear character gives a rich range of
results, making it possible to describe accurately different patterns. A
finite-difference semi- implicit splitting scheme is employed on the
discretization of the governing equation. Simulations were conducted
with realistic coefficients related to physical parameters
(anisotropies, beam orientation, diffusion). The study dealt with a
random and a monomode 1D structure initial condition in order to
understand how the shape and wavelength of the initial pattern evolve
with time. Ripples and hexagonal patterns were observed in the results,
being physically consistent with the phenomenon. Moreover, the Method of
Manufactured Solution has been used as verification of the developed
numerical scheme.
