# ABSTRACT:

This research aims to accurately simulate two-phase flow using the
Finite Element Method along with a Front Tracking method for capturing
the fluid interface. This is achieved by solving the Navier-Stokes
equations with varying properties over the fluid domain, using two
meshes, one representing both phases of the fluid and one representing
the fluid interface. The fluid mesh is fixed, and it is not altered
during the simulations. The interface mesh is advected by the velocity
fields, and is subjected to remeshing to maintain the same node density
in all areas. Since the interface mesh has considerably less nodes
compared to the fixed fluid mesh, the remeshing operation does not
increase the computational cost significantly. The two meshes are
decoupled, they do not share any nodes. The surface tension force is
calculated by evaluation of the interface mesh curvature by the
Laplace-Beltrami operator. This term is added to the Navier-Stokes
equation, and the velocity fields obtained from the FEM solution on the
fixed fluid mesh are used to advect the interface mesh. The surface
tension term is treated explicitly using the continuum surface force
model, and calculated using the curvature obtained by the application of
a finite element discretization of the Laplace-Beltrami operator to the
interface mesh. The chosen finite element is the Mini element, in order
to respect the LBB condition, avoiding the addition of artificial
stabilization terms. The convective term in the Navier-Stokes equation
is discretized through a first order semi- Lagrangian method. Fluid
properties at the interface are smoothed through a Heaviside function to
avoid numerical instability, over an artificial thickness of the fluid
interface. To validate the method discussed, some test cases are pro-
posed. The first test is the static droplet, where surface tension
forces are balanced by the pressure gradient. In this test no velocities
should appear, any velocity values are due to numerical errors,
therefore the lower, the better. The second test is the oscillating
droplet, where a droplet of fluid with a slight perturbation in its
diameter is released with no gravity forces. The droplet should
oscillate with a known frequency towards a spherical shape. Lastly, the
rising bubble test case, where the gravity forces promote the bubbleâ€™s
ascension in quiescent fluid. The bubble shape evolution can be compared
to experimental data.
