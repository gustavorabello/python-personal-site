# ABSTRACT:

Several numerical simulations of drug release from coronary drug-eluting
stents were formerly performed by the authors through MatlabÂ© and Octave
to understand transport and binding mechanisms over the device/artery
interface. As a continued effort, this paper is intended to reproduce
results previously obtained of pressure distribution and velocity field,
now employing Gridap, a Julia language-based library, able to explore
different approaches of approximation Finite Element spaces, and high
performance solution strategies. We compared results obtained employing
diverse numerical and computational choices, such as variable mesh
refinement levels, finite element interpolation order, pre-conditioner
classes, and solver configurations (architecture, memory,
multi-threading, etc.). The proposed benchmark problem, even addressing
a relatively simple geometry and a linear differential equation, has
singular regions that cause numerical difficulties, thus limiting the
rate of convergence of the numerical approximations. The main
contribution of the paper is to show the benefits of employing Julia as
a programming language for scientific applications, and Gridap as a
Finite Element library, which provided easy access to high performance
resources as multi threading, parallel processing, GPU acceleration,
thus great versatility in solving complex problems.
