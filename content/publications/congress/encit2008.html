# ABSTRACT:

Multiphase bubbly flows are important in many industrial applications.
One important application is the simulation of hydrate formation in oil
and gas industry. In fact, hydrate formation is considered one of the
most important problems in the oil industry. As off-shore production
migrates to deeper zones, hydrate formation in lines and production
equipment becomes a more severe restriction. The study of the first
stages of hydrate formation requires the knowledge of lift and drag
forces over bubbles and drops. Hence, detailed modeling of bubble flows
and interface phenomena is required for the understanding of hydrate
formation dynamics. This work presents a novel method to solve 3D bubble
flows. The method is based on a ALE approach on an unstructured Finite
Element discretization using the Taylor-Hood Mini element. The surface
tension effects are included in a consistent way, avoiding spurious
oscillations and parasitic currents. The convective terms are
discretized using a semi-Lagrangian technique, which is unconditionally
stable for arbitrary integration time steps and Reynolds numbers. The
pressure and velocity computations are decoupled employing a projection
method based on an approximate block LU factorization, producing a very
efficient methodology. Interface is represented by faces, edges and
vertices of the tetrahedralization. The interfacial vertices are moved
in a Lagrangian fashion, while the other vertices are moved in order to
keep the good quality of the mesh, thus avoiding remeshing procedures.
The method is an extension of the method described in [Sousa et al.] for
the simulation of 3d flows. The method was validated against analytical
solutions in simple cases, as well as experimental results with bubbles,
showing excellent mass conservation properties, stability, and
computational performance.
