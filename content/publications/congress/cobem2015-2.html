# ABSTRACT:

Numerical simulations comparing the accuracy of trajectory integrators
are presented in this paper through a qualitative error analysis. The
core methodology presents one- and two-level schemes to be applied for
incompressible flow problems discretised by the Taylor-Hoodâ€™s MINI
element. Emphasis is given to a time-stepping algorithm which seeks
intermediary values of the advected quantity to capture precisely the
trajectory of particles. Analises are organized regarding numerical
tests that bring up the overall differences associated to each of the
semi-lagrangian integrators. Comparisons take into account the advection
of a scalar concentrate over a two-dimensional domain when submitted to
a rotating velocity field, thereby highlighting the advantages of the
sub-step integrator for simulating flows that experience, mainly,
swirling or curved motions.
