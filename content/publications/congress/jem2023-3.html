# ABSTRACT:

This work aims to present a computational approach to study two-phase
flows using direct numerical simulation. The flows are modeled by the
two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, which are
approximated by the Finite Element Method. The Galerkin formulation is
used to discretize the Navier-Stokes equations in the spatial domain and
the semi-Lagrangian method is used to discretize the material derivative
in the temporal domain. A static unstructured triangular mesh is defined
in the whole spatial domain. In order to satisfy the
Ladyzhenskaya–Babuška–Brezzi condition, the mini and the quadratic
elements are used, with pressure and velocity fields being calculated on
different sets of the triangular mesh points. The interface is modeled
by an adaptive moving one-dimensional mesh, according to a front-
tracking method, in which connected marker points are moved with the
imposed velocity of the triangular mesh. The interfacial tension is
calculated using the interface curvature and a Heaviside function
gradient, and included in the Navier-Stokes equations as a volume force.
In order to stabilize the simulation results, a smooth transition
between fluid properties is defined on the interface region. Several
benchmark tests, such as the rising bubble and the oscillating drop,
have been carried out to validate the proposed approach and the obtained
results have matched analytical solutions and results found in
literature. Therefore, the presented approach is validated to provide an
accurate description of diverse two-phase flow phenomena.
