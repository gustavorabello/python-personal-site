# ABSTRACT:

The present work aims at developing a computational framework to simulate coronary artery flows in cartesian coordinates. An accurate method capable of capturing the flow dynamics is strictly required. In this paper a Finite Element Method (FEM) is used to solve the governing equations of the motion of the blood flow found in coronary artery as incompressible fluid using the stream-vorticity formulation with coupled species transport equation.
