# ABSTRACT:

In this work, a description of heat and mass transfer in two phase flows
is presented, using a Lagrangian-Eulerian decoupled mesh method,
similar to that of front tracking methods. The “one fluid” formulation
for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for two-phase flows is
solved through the Finite Element Method, coupled with the energy
equation for a fluid without viscous dissipation and heat source. Two
distinct meshes are used, one fixed mesh representing both fluid phases,
and a mesh representing the fluid interface. The mini element is
utilized in order to respect the Ladyzenskaja-Babuska-Brezzi condition
in the fluid, thereby avoiding artificial stabilization schemes. The
advective terms of the momentum and energy equation are discretized
using a semi-Lagrangian method. The mass transfer will be accounted
through an added term to the conservation of mass equation, updated at
each time step. The fluid phases are identified through the use of a
Heaviside function anchored at the interface. This same function is used
to smooth fluid properties over the interface, reducing the property
gradient and avoiding possible numerical instability. The inter- face
curvature is calculated through the Laplace-Beltrami operator, and the
surface tension force derived from it. The methodology is tested by
simulating the bubble growing in superheated fluid test case and
comparing it to existing data.
