# ABSTRACT:

This work aims at presenting a computational approach to study two-phase
flows and the coalescence phenomenon using direct numerical simulation.
The flows are modeled by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations,
which are approximated by the Finite Element Method. The Galerkin
formulation is used to discretize the Navier-Stokes equations in the
spatial domain and the semi-Lagrangian method is used to discretize the
material derivative backward in time. In order to satisfy the
Ladyzhenskaya–Babusˇka–Brezzi condition, high-order pair of elements are
used, with pressure and velocity fields being calculated on different
sets of the unstructured mesh nodes. The interface is modeled by an
uncoupled adaptive moving mesh, where interface nodes are tracked in a
Lagrangian fashion and moved with the velocity solution of the motion
equations. The interface tension is computed using the interface
curvature and the gradient of a Heaviside function, and added in the
momentum equations as a volume force. In order to stabilize the
simulation, a smooth transition between fluid properties is defined on
the interface region. Several benchmark tests have been carried out to
validate the proposed approach, and the obtained results have
demonstrated agreement with analytical solutions and results reported in
the literature. A coalescence modeling is also proposed considering
geometric parameters and results show interesting dynamics.
