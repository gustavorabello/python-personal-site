# ABSTRACT:

Proceeding with previous works made by DosAnjos(2007) and Oliveira(2011)
in their M.Sc. Dissertations, developed in the Metalurgy and Materials
Graduate Program of the Instituto Alberto Luiz Coimbra (COPPE – Brazil),
this work deals with the introduction of new features in a FEM – Finite
Element Method code originally written by those authors, for the study
of the hydrodynamic stability in electrochemical cells with rotating
disk electrode A review of the related bibliography and the relevance of
the subject can be found on the two cited M.Sc. Dissertations.
Currently, the FEM Code developed in our group features a first order in
time semi-Lagrangean scheme for interpolation of the shape functions for
MINI elements. On a first step, QUADRATIC elements is now implemented,
for discretization of the spatial domain. The following step, not yet
implementd, will cope with the implementation of a second order in time
semi-Lagrangea scheme. It is expected that both features will improve
the precision of the results obtained with the code.
