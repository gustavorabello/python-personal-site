# ABSTRACT:

Iron rotating disk electrodes are widely in applied electrochemistry due
to the fact of requiring an easily built experimental setup and to the
existence of a simple semi-analytical similarity solution for the steady
hydrodynamic equations describing the flow close to the electrode. Based
on this solution the current in the cell is theoretically evaluated and
compared to the experimental results. A caveat of such experimental
apparatus results from the fact that, particularly at high current
regimes, dissolution of the iron electrode in the 1M H2SO4 solution of
the electrolyte endamages the geometry of the electrode surface and the
electrode no longer can be used. An alternative to overcome the problem
consists in using rotating semi-spherical electrodes, which keep the
geometry in the dissolution process. However, no similarity solution
exists for the complete hydrodynamic equations exits for this case.
First, a boundary layer approximation is required to describe the flow
in the neighborhood of the electrode and second, a solution is found, in
terms of a power series of the polar angle, multiplying functions
describing the dependency of the velocity componentes on the radial
coordinate. In this work we briefly review the principles of the power
series solution for the steady solution of the boundary layer developed
by constant viscosity electrolytes close to rotating semi-spherical
electrodes and propose a numerical Finite Element (FEM) procedure to
obtain the velocity profiles for polar angles (southern direction)
ranging 0, angle, pi/2. Spatial discretization of the diffusive and
pressure terms is performed by the Galerkin method, and of the material
derivative, through the Semi-lagrangian method. The numerical code,
developed in C++, uncouples the velocity and pressure through the
discrete projection method. Conjugate gradient method is used to solve
the velocity whereas pressure is solved with the generalized minimal
residual method (GMRES). The results obtained are compared with the
semi-analytical solution obtained by the power series method. The effect
of boundary conditions imposed in the simulations at the equator plane
is analyzed and compared to the conditions assumed in the
semi-analytical solution.
