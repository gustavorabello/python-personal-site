# ABSTRACT:

The current study aims at simulating flows in both free-flow and porous
regions. The discretization of mass and momentum equations, using the
Finite Element Method (FEM), are presented. Also, the semi-lagrangian
technique, where unconditional stability is successfully achieved for
the numerical solution in different geometries, is developed. For porous
and conjugated flows, the Darcy-Forchheimer term is included in the
classical Navier-Stokes equation, so that the resistance imposed by the
porous medium is considered in the pressure gradient. A second-order
spatial convergence is assured for velocity and temperature fields,
since a quadratic + linear pair of triangle mesh elements is used,
fulfilling the well-known LBB condition. The MINI element is used to
verify the results with the literature as well. Energy balance is also
made in this work, so that the temperature field can be determined along
the domain, evidentiating the differences between free-flow and porous
domains with respect to not only pressure and velocity field
distribution but also how the medium interferes with heat transfer
phenomena. A benchmark validation for the finite element method applied
to fluid mechanics is provided and the well-known case of Poiseuille
flow is simulated using both media in order to compare the pressure
along the channel for the two cases. As expected, a porous medium
imposes a higher pressure gradient on the flow, but with lower values
for the velocity field. The mass flow for both cases is the same, but a
flatter curve is observed in the porous domain due to the effects
imposed by the resistance of the medium. Graphical results are shown to
illustrate and compare all the cases simulated in this work.
