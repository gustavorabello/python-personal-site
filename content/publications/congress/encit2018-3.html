# ABSTRACT:

The safety and efficacy of Drug-eluting stents is strongly influenced by
the anisotropic transport of the antiproliferative/anti-inflammatory
drugs in the arterial wall. Dissolution in the polymer coating and
specific binding in the artery wall play an important role in the
process. We consider the model of dissolution, transport and binding of
sirolimus on an axisymmetric domain representing the polymer coating
layer and the porous artery wall in the vicinity of a stent strut. We
employ the FEM on an unstructured mesh to discretise the governing
equations. We employ a non-linear dissolution model for the dynamics in
the coating, and a non-linear saturable binding model that includes both
specific and non-specific binding in the arterial wall as separate
phases, as proposed by McGinty-2016. The arterial wall is considered an
anisotropic porous media and the flow is considered to be governed by
Darcy flow. The principal directions of the diffusion tensor are
considered to be, in general, non aligned with the Cartesian coordinates
and are determined by the gradient of signed distance function computed
from the inner arterial wall. The permeability in the polymer coating is
considered to be very small, but finite. The endothelium lamina, where
present, is modelled as a no-flow boundary. The effect of slow and fast
release polymers is considered, showing that the time evolution of the
process can be efficiently controlled by the polymer diffusion
coefficient. However, the spatial distribution of the sirolimus is
greatly influenced by the flow and the arterial wall properties, being
therefore susceptible to patient health conditions. The effect of the
anisotropic diffusion tensor is seen in the sirolimus concentration
distribution around the polymer layer, that becomes considerably higher
and more uniform around the stent than in the orthotropic model, and in
the enhanced mass flux, resulting form the realignment of the principal
directions of the tensor with the direction of the interface.
