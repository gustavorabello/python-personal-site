# ABSTRACT:

Biofuels have gained significant popularity as they are a clean and
renewable energy source when compared to conventional fossil fuels.
Biodiesel is produced from monoalkyl esters derived from vegetable oils,
animal fats or other materials composed mainly of triglycerols. In
addition to several other important applications, biodiesel is
predominantly used as a vehicle fuel, where it is blended with
conventional petroleum-derived diesel. Microreactor technology, an
essential method for process intensification, offers numerous potential
advantages for process industries. Two-phase reactions with mass
transfer limitations can be effectively conducted on a small scale in a
slow-flow two-phase microreactor. In this type of reactor, alternating
and uniform segments (slugs) of the two- phase reaction mixture exhibit
areas of mass transfer between phases and well-defined flow patterns.
The circulations within these slugs are not completely understood and
require systematic numerical analyzes and the development of advanced
mathematical models for better understanding and optimization.
Furthermore, the application of microreactors can lead to greater energy
efficiency and waste reduction in biofuel production. These compact
reactors allow for more precise control of reaction conditions, which
can result in higher quality products and more sustainable processes.
The objective of this work is to study the behavior of two-phase flow
through a capillary microreactor for the production of biodiesel, using
the homogeneous flow model, where the two phases move at equal speeds
and increasing the mixing level, thus being able to be treated as if
were a single phase. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach is
then used to numerically simulate this type of flow in quadrilateral
unstructured meshes. The flows are modeled by the incompressible
two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations, written using the
current-vorticity function formulation, which are approximated by the
Finite Element Method. The Python programming language was used to
develop the computational code. After checking the code, characteristic
flows in microchannels were analyzed, comparing the numerical results
with experimental results from the literature. Good results were found
with this methodology.
