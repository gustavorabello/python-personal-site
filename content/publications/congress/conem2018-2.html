# ABSTRACT:

The numerical simulation is an important tool to solve problems found in
several physical processes, such as oil drilling, reservoir filling,
hemodynamics and cooling of electronic components, the latter of great
importance for describing problems related to controling flow and
temperature conditions for new generation of stack processors. It is in
this scope this project retains, for the development and improvement of
a numerical platform using finite elements method simulation in order to
study, in details, physical processes involved in cooling the eletronic
components, specifically the characterization of temperature
distribution in flows within different geometry. With this project, the
objective is to comprehend, in detail, the mechanisms of heat
dissipation in modern electronic components. Furthermore, it is also
desired to have a better understanding of which alternatives present the
most efficient cooling.
