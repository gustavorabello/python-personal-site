# ABSTRACT:

The present work aims at developing a computational framework to simulate coronary artery flows in cartesian coordinates. The Finite Element Method (FEM) is used to solve the governing equations of the blood flow in coronary artery with drug-eluting stent placed. The blood was modeled as single-phase, incompressible and newtonian fluid. The Navier-Stokes equation is shown according to the stream-vorticity formulation with coupled species transport equation. The Taylor-Galerkin scheme were used to decrease spurious oscillations as seen for moderate to high Reynolds number.
