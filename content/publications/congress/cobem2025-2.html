# ABSTRACT:

Vortex-induced vibration (VIV) is a well-known problem in the offshore
industry, especially when dealing with riser dynamics. This issue arises due to
the nonlinear interaction between the fluid flow past cylindrical structures,
which generate a von Karman vortex street. This vortex shedding phenomenon
causes pressure differentials, which generate oscillating forces such as lift
and drag. These forces induce vibrations that may lead to structural failure
due to mechanical fatigue. This study focuses on the analysis of the physical
problem using a bidimensional approach. The flow of fluids around blunt objects
creates a wake behind the geometry, which excites the structure, making it
oscillate in the transverse direction of the flow. To accurately model the
intricate dynamics of this phenomenon, we employ the non-dimensional
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations within the arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian
(ALE) framework. This enables us to account for large mesh motion and
effectively describe the complex fluid-structure interactions. The finite
element method (FEM) has been chosen to discretize the equations and the
five-noded quadrilateral was used to discretize the fluid domain, which
automatically satisfies the Ladyzhenskaya–Babuška–Brezzi (LBB) condition, also
known as the “inf- sup” condition. In order to stabilize the numerical code for
higher Reynolds numbers, a first-order semi-Lagrangian (SL) scheme has been
used. This method is unconditionally stable thus, large time steps may be used
if necessary. The search-interpolation algorithm is remarkably efficient since
it starts by inquiring about one of the node’s neighbouring elements. On the
other hand, the solid structure was considered a rigid body therefore, its
boundary was non-deformable. Several benchmark test cases have been
investigated to confirm the accuracy of the proposed methodology. As for
results, the flow past a moving cylinder and other blunt geometries in which
the Reynolds number varies between 100 and 1000 was investigated. Flow patterns
due to the vortex-shedding phenomenon are also presented. This study allows for
a better understanding of the dynamics of the problem, as well as the
development of mitigation strategies.
