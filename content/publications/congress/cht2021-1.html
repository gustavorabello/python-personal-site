# ABSTRACT:

Particle-laden multiphase flow is an important subject of study in fluid
mechanics, especially in the oil and gas industry. In this work, the
particle emission from biofuel production is analyzed and simulated, in
order to obtain the main effects of such transportation into the
atmosphere, that may cause environmental and health damages. The
continuous phase is numerically simulated directly through the
Navier-Stokes equations, for which the results are in complete
accordance to the ones presented in the literature. As for the solid
dispersion, an Euler-Lagrange analysis is made, which provides a better
understanding of each particle trajectory. A numerical simulator is
built by means of The Finite Element Method (FEM) and the results are
generated for different meshes, which are made for different geometries.
All the results and comparisons are shown and discussed throughout this
article.
