# ABSTRACT:

The current study aims at simulating flows and their interaction with
solid structures. The discretization of mass and momentum equations,
using the Finite Element Analysis (FEA), is presented. Also the
semi-Lagrangian (SL) technique, where unconditional stability is
successfully achieved for the numerical solution in different
geometries, is developed. For the solid domain, a two-dimensional
approach was used with a quadratic triangular element mesh in a daynamic
simulation. As for the fluid domain, a second order special convergence
is assured for velocity fields, since a quadratic + linear pair of
triangular mesh elements is used, fulfilling the well-known LBB
condition. Then, results are compared with the literature, as a model
verification, and also other cases are evaluated. Benchmark validation
for the finite element method applied to fluid mechanics and membrane
solid cases are provided, as well as a modal analysis. First a static
model for the solid domain is compared with the literature, where a
clamped beam is considered for its maximum deflection. The dynamic case
is used to simulate vibration on that same beam, analyzing the motion
through time and its modes of vibration. Then, a fluid-structure
interaction is presented, where a beam is now subjected to the fluid’s
forces and the solid provides a physical boundary to the fluid’s
solution. Pressure and shear stresses are calculated in order to be used
as boundary forces to the solid structure. Thus, both domains are
evaluated and their influence on each other is studied using the
Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian, also known as ALE, technique, which is an
intermediate form between the Lagrangian and Eulerian methods, allowing
moving boundaries. One of the challenges is to reduce computational
cost, since finite element matrices need to be recalculated at each
step. A final case is presented, where a beam is subjected to shear and
bending stresses due to the flow of the fluid it is submerged in. Von
Mises stress is used to evaluate the efforts imposed to the solid body.
