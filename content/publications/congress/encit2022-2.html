# ABSTRACT:

Nowadays, air pollution is one of the greatest problems faced by
humanity and one of its main causes is the gases present in the
vehicle’s exhaust. In order to mitigate these problems in diesel-fueled
vehicles, it is usually used a device named Diesel Particulate Filter,
also known as DPF, which is responsible for filtering the particulates
contained in the exhausted air. Since currently there are very strict
laws regulating the quantity of particulate which are being exhausted
into the atmosphere, it is very important to study this device to ensure
its performance and to make improvements possible. So, to study the flow
behavior inside this device, this work aims to develop a computational
code using a CFD approach. This case was modeled as a single-phase air
flow inside the device and the air was modeled as an incompressible
Newtonian fluid. The governing equations of the flow are the
Navier-Stokes equations and, since there is a porous media inside the
DPF, the Darcy-Forchheimer model is used in the Navier-Stokes equations
to represent the effects of this region. The Finite Element Method (FEM)
was the numerical method used, using a semi-Lagrangian method to
discretize the derivative material and the Galerkin approximation to
discretize the other terms in the spatial domain. After all, it is
necessary to verify if the code provides results consistent with
reality. In order to do that, it is simulated cases in which the results
are well established in the literature, making it possible to compare
code and literature results and to verify the results’ consistency. This
verification shows that the code is highly reliable.
