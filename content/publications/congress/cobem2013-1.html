# ABSTRACT:

A dual strategy of remeshing and smoothing operations is introduced into
the recent Arbitrary Lagrangian- Eulerian/Finite Element code developed
for modeling of two-phase flows and heat transfer. At the forefront, the
approach is introduced not only to discretize the continuum filled by
the liquid and vapor phases but also to represent their common interface
by computational elements. While in synchrony, a Level-Set (LS)
methodology has now been introduced to better model the coalescing
regions. Therefore, this work presents a two-dimensional idealized model
concerning the numerical modeling of the coalescence between two
circular bubbles immersed in stagnant liquid. While the ALE/FE approach
can guarantee suitable remeshing to recover the structure of the mesh
after the thin liquid film disruption, the LS strategy locally
determines the coalescing region by application of a function of compact
support. The effect of the collapse is assuaged and any sharpnesses
owing to local topological changes occurring in the contact region tend
to be less protruding by smoothing. Two-dimensional numerical results
show that this incipient methodology is a promising technique in regard
to coalescence studies and is able to be extended, a posteriori, to
three-dimensional cases. Developed mainly to deal with bubble
interactions, these strategies aim to be embodied, in the future, into a
two-phase flow context, especially to simulate the coalescence taking
place in transitional regions of passage from bubbly-to-slug and
slug-to-annular patterns.
