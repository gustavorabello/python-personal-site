# ABSTRACT:

Fluid-structure interactions are essential to be evaluated in pipelines where the fluid dynam- ics induces structural vibrations that need to be prop- erly investigated for engineering design. The flow of internal fluids can be laminar or turbulent, which makes such analysis a complex task. This paper investigates the analysis of Fluid-structure interac- tion from reduced-order models where a Bernoulli– Euler beam is employed to represent the pipe while fluid dynamics is represented by nonlinear oscillators. Structural analysis employs the Galerkin method for spatial discretization. Fluid dynamics is described by considering van der Pol oscillator together with the Langevin equation. In this regard, laminar and tur- bulent responses are described. Results show that the reduced-order model allows one to replicate the fre- quency spectrum of the pipeline response considering the parametric variation of the flow velocity and sto- chastic fluctuations. Nonlinear dynamics perspective shows to be interesting representing instabilities and some complex responses as limit cycle behavior.
