# ABSTRACT:

This work’s goal is to numerically investigate the interactions between
two gas bubbles in a fluid flow in a circular cross-section channel,
both in the presence and in the absence of gravitational forces, with
several Reynolds and Weber numbers. The first bubble is placed at the
center of the channel, while the second is near the wall. Their
positions are set in such a way that a dynamic interaction is expected
to occur due to their velocity differences. A finite element numerical
tool is utilized to solve the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations and
simulate two-phase flow using an unfitted mesh to represent the fluid
interface, akin to the front-tracking method. The results show that the
velocity gradient influences bubble shapes near the wall. Moreover,
lower viscosity and surface tension force account for more significant
interactions, both in the bubble shape and in the trajectory. In this
scenario, it can be observed that one bubble is trapped in the other’s
wake, with the proximity possibly allowing the onset of coalescence. The
results obtained contribute to a deeper understanding of two-phase inner
flows.
