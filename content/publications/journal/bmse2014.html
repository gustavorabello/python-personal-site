# ABSTRACT:

This paper deals with the numerical simulation of rotating disk flow,
coupling the hydrodynamic field to the transport of a chemical species
generated in electrochemical cells by the dissolution of an iron
electrode in a 1M H2SO4 electrolyte. The time asymptotic steady-state
solution of rotating disk flow obtained in this work by numerical
integration of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations through the
finite element method (FEM) with the appropriate boundary conditions is
consistent with the generalized von Kármán’s similarity solution. This
paper reviews the main features of generalized von Kármán’s flow, the
adopted FEM scheme, a discussion of implementation of the boundary
conditions, validation of the code and the results. In particular, the
results confirm the assumption that the non-dimensional velocity and
concentration profiles do not depend on the coordinate along the radial
direction.
