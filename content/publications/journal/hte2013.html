# ABSTRACT:

We seek to study numerically two-phase flow phenomena with phase change
through the finite-element method (FEM) and the arbitrary
Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) framework. This method is based on the
so-called “one-fluid” formulation; thus, only one set of equations is
used to describe the flow field at the vapor and liquid phases. The
equations are discretized on an unstructured tetrahedron mesh and the
interface between the phases is defined by a triangular surface, which
is a subset of the three-dimensional mesh. The Navier–Stokes equation is
used to model the fluid flow with the inclusion of a source term to
compute the interfacial forces that arise from two-phase flows. The
continuity and energy equations are slightly modified to take into
account the heat and mass transport between the different phases. Such a
methodology can be employed to study accurately many problems, such as
oil extraction and refinement in the petroleum area, design of
refrigeration systems, modeling of biological systems, and efficient
cooling of electronics for computational purposes, which is the aim of
this research. A comparison of the obtained numerical results to the
classical literature is performed and presented in this paper, thus
proving the capability of the proposed new methodology as a platform for
the study of diabatic two-phase flows.
