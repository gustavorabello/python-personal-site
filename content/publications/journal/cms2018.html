# ABSTRACT:

Nonlinear models for pattern evolution by ion beam sputtering on a
material surface present an ongoing oportunity for new numerical
simulations. A numerical analysis of the evolution of preexisting
patterns is proposed to investigate surface dynamics, based on a 2D
anisotropic damped Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, with periodic boundary
conditions. A finite-difference semi-implicit time splitting scheme is
employed on the discretization of the governing equation. Simulations
were conducted with realistic coefficients related to physical
parameters - anisotropies, beam orientation, diffusion-. The stability of
the numerical scheme is analyzed with time step and grid spacing tests
for the pattern evolution, and the Method of Manufactured Solutions has
been used to verify the proposed scheme. Ripples and hexagonal patterns
were obtained from a monomodal initial condition for certain values of
the damping coefficient, while spatiotemporal chaos appeared for lower
values. The anisotropy effects on pattern formation were studied,
varying the angle of incidence of the ion beam with respect to the
irradiated surface. Analytical discussions are based on linear and
weakly nonlinear analysis.
