# ABSTRACT:

This work aims at investigating numerically the effects of channel corrugation in two- phase flows with single and multiples drops subject to buoyancy-driven motion. A state-of-the- art model is employed to accurately compute the dynamics of the drop’s interface deformation using a modern moving frame/moving mesh technique within the arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian framework, which allows one to simulate very large domains. The results reveal a complex and interesting dynamics when more than one drop is present in the system, leading eventually in coalescence due to the amplitude of the corrugated sinusoidal channel and distance between drops.
