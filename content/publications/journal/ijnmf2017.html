# ABSTRACT:

A boundary-fitted moving mesh scheme is presented for the simulation of
two-phase flow in two-dimensional and axisymmetric geometries. The
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved using the Finite
Element Method (FEM) and the mini element is used to satisfy the inf-sup
condition. The interface between the phases is represented explicitly by
an interface adapted mesh, thus allowing a sharp transition of the fluid
properties. Surface tension is modelled as a volume force and is
discretized in a consistent manner, thus allowing to obtain exact
equilibrium (up to rounding errors) with the pressure gradient. This is
demonstrated for a spherical droplet moving in a constant flow field.
The curvature of the interface, required for the surface tension term,
is efficiently computed with simple but very accurate geometric
formulas. An adaptive moving mesh technique, where smoothing mesh
velocities and remeshing are used to preserve the mesh quality, is
developed and presented. Mesh refinement strategies, allowing tailoring
of the refinement of the computational mesh, are also discussed.
Accuracy and robustness of the present method are demonstrated on
several validation test cases. The method is developed with the prospect
of being applied to microfluidic flows and the simulation of
microchannel evaporators used for electronics cooling. Therefore, the
simulation results for the flow of a bubble in a microchannel are
presented and compared to experimental data.
