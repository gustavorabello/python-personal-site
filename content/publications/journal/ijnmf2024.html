# ABSTRACT:

This work aims at presenting a new computational approach to study two
and three dimensional two-phase flows and two dimensional coalescence
phenomenon using direct numerical simulation. The flows are modeled by
the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, which are approximated by
the Finite Element Method. The Galerkin formulation is used to
discretize the Navier-Stokes equations in the spatial domain and the
semi-Lagrangian method is used to discretize the material derivative. In
order to satisfy the Ladyzhenskaya–Babuska–Brezzi condition, high-order
stable pair of elements are used, with pressure and velocity fields
being calculated on different degrees of freedom in the unstructured
mesh nodes. The interface is modeled by an unfitted adaptive moving
mesh, where interface nodes are tracked in a Lagrangian fashion and
moved with the velocity solution of the fluid motion equations. The
surface tension is computed using the interface curvature and the
gradient of a Heaviside function, and added in the momentum equations as
a body force. In order to avoid undesired spurious modes at the
interface due to high property ratios, a smooth transition between fluid
properties is defined on the interface region. Several benchmark tests
have been carried out to validate the proposed approach, and the
obtained results have demonstrated agreement with analytical solutions
and numerical results reported in the literature. A coalescence model is
also proposed based on geometric criteria and results show interesting
dynamics.
