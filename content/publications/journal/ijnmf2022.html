# ABSTRACT:

Semi-lagrangian (SL) schemes are of utmost relevance to simulate
two-phase flowswhere advection dominates. The combination of SL schemes
with the finite element(FE) method and arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian
(ALE) dynamic meshes yields astrong ingredient to deal with applications
in Earth sciences, environmental engineering, and oil and gas industry
whose numerical background is incipient. This paper isintended to
propose a second-order time multistep SL/ALE/FE scheme to track
par-ticle trajectories traveling amidst single- or two-phase
incompressible flows both infixed and moving mesh situations. The novel
scheme is a BDF2-like implementationthat considers the mesh velocity as
part of its backward-in-time integration. Trajectory departure points
are searched through extrapolation and followed by a multi step
interpolation corrector that works both for constant and varying time
steps. A seriesof two-phase benchmark flow simulations are carried out
by using the cubic elementto compare the performance of the new
integrator against single-step approximationsas well as to analyze
enhancements in representing the two-phase flow dynamics. Weuse the 2D
axisymmetric Navier-Stokes equations as underlying model. Error
analysis, convergence tests, quantitative and qualitative comparisons
are presented anddiscussed to highlight the superior conservative
feature of the novel scheme.
