# ABSTRACT:

This paper introduces a numerical model developed based upon the
arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian/finite element scheme to analyze bubble
plumes in a periodic domain. A spherical air bubble is immersed into a
large pool of quiescent water to act as an unconfined domain. While the
buoyancy force is the main physical mechanism driving the upward bubble
motion, an opposite pressure gradient is imposed over the flow to
balance the bulk liquid region. Periodic boundary conditions (PBC) are
used together with a moving-frame technique to provide good overall
analysis of the flow over a reduced computational mesh, thus reducing
the computational effort. The hypotheses of a fully developed regime as
well as a decomposition of the pressure field are embedded into a
“one-fluid” formulation of the incompressible Navier–Stokes, which deals
with the two-phase flow dynamics. Such an approach integrates a
PBC-corrected semi-lagrangian treatment of the advection and a robust
technique to handle the interface region in a zero-thickness fashion. At
last, full three-dimensional simulations comparing the model to both
numerical and experimental results concerning bubble shape factors and
path oscillation for different bubble diameters, Archimedes, and Eötvös
numbers are presented and discussed.
