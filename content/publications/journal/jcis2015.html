# ABSTRACT:

This paper presents a comparative study of transport effects in slug
flows through numerical models established upon volume-preserving
periodic arrays of bubbles. The behaviour of the flow is investigated
under an adiabatic laminar regime as usually found in microchannels, as
well as in microscale fluid ap- plications. Full 3D Direct Numerical
Simulations (DNS) are performed for three different cases of setups
containing both single and multiple bubbles. Profiles of the bubblesâ€™
centroidal velocity are compared, as with the average mass flow rates
calculated over the periodic boundaries of the domain.
