# ABSTRACT:

The present work aims at developing a new flexible computational 
framework to simulate macro and microscale two-phase flows with dynamic
bound- aries. Such a technique is extremely useful for periodic and very
large domains which requires exhaustive computational resources,
consequently reducing the required numerical domain. In this article an
interface tracking Finite Element (FE) method is used to solve the
equations governing the motion of two im- miscible incompressible fluids
in the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian framework (ALE). The equations are
written in axisymmetric coordinates, however the proposed moving
boundary technique can be easily extended to 3-dimensional flows and
other methods using the ALE framework such as the finite volume method.
The two-phase interface separating the fluids is a subset of the domain
mesh, therefore a layer of zero thickness is achieved assuring sharp
transition of properties among phases. At the scale of interest, surface
tension plays an important role and is thus considered in the flow
equations. Several validations and results are presented for gravity
dominated problem, including the sessile drop test and rising of
spherical and Taylor bubbles, as well as the divergent and sinusoidal
channels, showing accuracy for modeling two-phase flows in large
periodic domains.
