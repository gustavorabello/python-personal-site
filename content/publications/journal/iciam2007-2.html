# ABSTRACT:

We describe the main features of a numerical simulator currently under
development for studying water physico-chemical properties during the
flooding of hydroelectric plants reservoirs. The work is sponsored by
the brazilian Electric Energy National Agency ANEEL and conducted in a
joint work of brazilian universities rearchers, with Furnas Centrais
El√©tricas S. A., the leading brazilian power utility company. An
overview of the simulator requirements and of the involved partners is
given. The software modules and engineering solutions are briefly
discussed, including the finite element based transport module. Some
results, future steps and partnerships are presented and discussed.
