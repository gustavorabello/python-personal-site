# ABSTRACT:

Electrochemical cells containing an iron rotating disk electrode which
is dissolved in the electrolyte, an 1 M H2SO4 solution present a current
instability in the plateau region, where the current is controlled by
the mass transport. Dissolution of the electrode gives rise to a thin
concentration boundary layer, due to a Schmidt number Sc = 2000. This
boundary layer, together with the potential applied to the electrode,
leads to an increase in the fluid viscosity and in a decrease in the
diffusion coefficient, coupling the concentration and the chemical
species field. Since the current is proportional to the concentration
gradient at the interface, an instability of the coupled fields at
Reynolds numbers attained in experimental conditions could be
responsible for the current instability. Mangiavacchi [1] performed a
linear stability analysis of the problem and showed that this is indeed
the case. In this paper we review the main results of the stability
analysis and present the main features of the FEM code recently
developed in our group, to proceed with the investigation of the current
instability observed in electrochemical cells.
