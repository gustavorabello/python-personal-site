# ABSTRACT:

A 3D ALE Finite Element Method is developed to study two-phase flow
phenomena using a new discretization method to compute the surface
tension forces. The computational method is based on the Arbitrary
Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation (ALE) and the Finite Element Method
(FEM), creating a two-phase method with an improved model for the
liquid-gas interface. An adaptive mesh update procedure is also proposed
for effective management of the mesh to remove, add and repair elements,
since the computational mesh nodes move according to the flow. The ALE
description explicitly defines the two-phase interface position by a set
of interconnected nodes which ensures a sharp representation of the
boundary, including the role of the surface tension. The proposed
methodology for computing the curvature leads to accurate results with
moderate programming effort and computational cost. Static and dynamic
tests have been carried out to validate the method and the results have
compared well to analytical solutions and experimental results found in
the literature, demonstrating that the new proposed methodology provides
good accuracy to describe the interfacial forces and bubble dynamics.
This paper focuses on the description of the proposed methodology, with
particular emphasis on the discretization of the surface tension force,
the new remeshing technique, and the validation results. Additionally, a
microchannel simulation in complex geometry is presented for two
elongated bubbles.
