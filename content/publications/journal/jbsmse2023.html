# ABSTRACT:

Particle emission from biofuel consumption is analyzed and simulated, to
obtain the main effects of this emission into the atmosphere, which may
cause environmental and health damage. The continuous phase is numer-
ically simulated through the Navier-Stokes equations coupled with the
Darcy-Forchheimer model, for which the results are in accordance with
the ones presented in the literature. For the solid dispersion calculation,
a Lagrangian analysis is made, which provides a better understanding
of each particle trajectory, therefore resulting in a one-way coupling
Euler-Lagrangian numerical simulation. A numerical simulator is built
using the Finite Element Method (FEM) and verified with some classi-
cal cases in the literature. To simulate and compare particulate filtering
mechanisms of diesel engines, the DPF (Diesel Particle Filter) model
is used with particle size distribution referring to diesel and biodiesel,
being possible to make a comparison in particulate pollutant emis-
sions. Several filter geometries are evaluated, regarding their efficiency in
particle retention rate, to obtain a different design of the filter that en-
hances filtration efficiency, where the external steep-edged DPF has been
shown to provide the best results. Thus, in this work, the finite element
method is used to propose an optimization of each channel of the DPF,
resulting in a lower particle emission for both diesel and biodiesel fuels.
