# ABSTRACT:

The present work aims at developing a numerical study on the drug
diffusion in the bloodstream in a coronary artery with drug-eluting
stent implanted. The blood was modeled as a single-phase, incompressible
and Newtonian fluid and the Navierâ€“Stokes equation was approxi- mated
according to the Finite Element Method (FEM). The dynamics of
drug-eluting concentration in bloodstream was investigated using four
drug-eluting stents with different mass diffusivities in microchannels
with variable cross sections, including a real coronary artery geometry
with atheroscle- rosis. The results reveal complex drug concentration
patterns and accumulation in the vicinity of the fat buildup.
