# ABSTRACT:

This study investigates three-dimensional two-phase flows in complex geometries
found in industrial process equipment design using finite-element numerical
simulations. The governing equations are formulated in three-dimensional
Cartesian coordinates and solved on unstructured meshes employing the
Taylor–Hood “Mini” element, selected for its numerical stability and
convergence properties. The convective term in the momentum equation is
discretized using a first-order semi-Lagrangian scheme. The two fluid phases
are separated by an interface mesh composed of triangular surface elements,
which is independent of the primary volumetric fluid mesh. Surface tension
effects are incorporated as a source term using the continuum surface force
(CSF) model, with the curvature computed via the Laplace–Beltrami operator. At
each time step, the positions of the interface mesh nodes are updated according
to the local fluid velocity field. The results show that the methodology is
stable and can be used to accurately model two-phase flows in complex
geometries found in several engineering solutions.
