From February 2019 I have been appointed as an adjunct professor of
fluid dynamics and Heat Transfer at the Mechanical Department of the
Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UERJ) located at the surrounding
area of the city of Rio de Janeiro. I dedicate my work time in teaching
and research. 

{%- endmark %}

I teach Numerical Heat Transfer and Fluid Dynamics for
undergraduate students and Multiphase Flows for graduate students
(master and doctoral levels).  

I am member the Brazilian Society of Mechanical Engineering and I'm part
of the organizing committee of the International Conference on
Multiphase Flows (ICMF) to be held in Rio de Janeiro in May 2019.
