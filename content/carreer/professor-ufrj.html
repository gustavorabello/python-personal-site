{% mark excerpt -%}

From February 2019 I have been appointed as adjunct professor of Fluid
Dynamics and Heat Transfer at the Department of Mechanical Engineering
of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UERJ) located at the
surrounding area of the city of Rio de Janeiro. I dedicate my work time
in teaching and in several research topics related to Computational
Fluid Dynamics (CFD).

I currently teach Numerical Heat Transfer and Fluid Dynamics for
undergraduate students and Multiphase Flows and CFD for graduate students
(master and doctoral levels). I am supervising some B.Sc., M.Sc. and
Ph.D. students in numerical methods for fluid dynamics.
