{% mark excerpt -%}

Followed by the end of my bachelor's project, I started my masters
studies at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) in the
Metallurgical and Materials Engineering Department (COPPE). The period
of two years is required to receive the Master's degree and during this
period we must follow some courses and write a dissertation based on a
specific theme.

We have chosen to follow three directions of courses:
scientific computing, mathematics and fluid mechanics, all of them were
done in their respective departments. The aim of the masters thesis was
to develop a three dimensional Finite Element code, under the
object-oriented paradigm, to simulate the flow field close to an
electrochemical cell immerse in h3SO4 solution. The Navier-Stokes's
equations were used to model the real system. We used the
Semi-Lagrangian approach to treat the convective (non-linear) term,
present in the equations, which is one of the most problematic issue in
such a modelling. The others terms namely pressure and viscous terms,
were discretized by the standard Galerkin method. The final linear
system Ax=b was treated by the LU projection method, thus decoupling
velocity and pressure in two smaller systems. In 2007 I received my
master's degree (M.Sc.).
