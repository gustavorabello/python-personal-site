The topic of the doctorate is two-phase flow and heat transfer in
microchannels. One of the major aspects of this thesis will be to extend
the single phase code (developed during the masters studies) and
implement two-phase and heat transfer bringing the surface tension
effects into the code for elongated bubble flows, annular flows and
bubbly flows (for both evaporating flows and perhaps also for some
condensating two-phase flows).
